No matter the settings I gave the BMC it was getting two IP addresses. One on the IPMI_LAN port as expected in my management VLAN, and another on eth0 which is undesirable.

It turns a Raspberry Pi into an IP based KVM switch that lets you remote control any machine from anywhere in the world! You can build your own, or buy a pre-assembled PiKVM like I did. In this video we try to scale the PiKVM to 8 devices, but things don't always go as planned.

Controlling multiple systems that don't have IPMI natively, remotely. Thanks to PiKVM, now we can.
