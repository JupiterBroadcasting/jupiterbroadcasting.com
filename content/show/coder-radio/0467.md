  * [Richard Field on Twitter](https://twitter.com/tyillc/status/1528403159156150272 "Richard Field on Twitter") — So to retain its mythical credibility, will Fed follow through on its forward guidance and raise rates thereby making the recession more severe or will the Fed say, wait, all the contemporaneous data we have suggests we are in a recession, so time to halt rate increases?
  * [The Labor Market Just Cratered](https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/fed-mission-accomplished-real-time-indicators-show-labor-market-just-cratered "The Labor Market Just Cratered") — The Fed will be hard-pressed to drive inflation down towards its 2% target without raising the unemployment rate meaningfully, which in turn will require a significant downshift in labor demand. 
  * [The Cantillon Effect: Why Wall Street Gets a Bailout and You Don't](https://mattstoller.substack.com/p/the-cantillon-effect-why-wall-street?s=r "The Cantillon Effect: Why Wall Street Gets a Bailout and You Don't") — The reason is because money has to travel through institutions, and right now, the institutions for the powerful function well, and those for the rest of us are rickety and broken. So money gets to the rich first. Eventually, some money will get to the rest of us, but in the interim period before that money fully circulates, the wealthy can use their access to money to buy up physical or financial assets.
