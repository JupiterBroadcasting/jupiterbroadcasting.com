bio: 'I maintain Bustle and Gnome Initial Setup, and sporadically contribute to various
  other bits and bobs around the GNOME ecosystem.

  When I’m at work, I’m Director of Platform at Endless OS Foundation. Unless otherwise
  specified, I don’t speak for them or any past employers, even if I’m discussing
  work I did for them. Outside work, I sometimes do other stuff and write about it.'
