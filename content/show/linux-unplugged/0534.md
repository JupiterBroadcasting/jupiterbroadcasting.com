  * [Fedora 39 Delayed To At Least 7 November](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Fedora-39-Delayed-To-7-Nov "Fedora 39 Delayed To At Least 7 November") ‚Äî While Fedora 39 was aiming for an ideal "early final" release on 18 October, that didn't happen, it was delayed, and then delayed again. Now the earliest Fedora 39 will possibly shift is 7 November.

  * [Linux Mint Starts working on Wayland Support](https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=4591 "Linux Mint Starts working on Wayland Support") ‚Äî The work started on Wayland. As mentioned earlier this year, this was identified as one of the major challenges our project had to tackle in the mid to long term.
  * [Cinnamon Wayland Trello](https://trello.com/b/HHs01Pab/cinnamon-wayland "Cinnamon Wayland Trello")

  * [Six Great Features With The Upcoming Linux 6.6 Kernel](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.6-Great-Features "Six Great Features With The Upcoming Linux 6.6 Kernel") ‚Äî While there were many last minute fixes this week, the changes don't appear to be too scary or invasive. In any event the Linux 6.6 kernel is bringing some exciting features.
  * [Linux 6.6 Features Include The EEVDF Scheduler, Shadow Stack, Intel IVSC, AMD DBC & More](https://www.phoronix.com/review/linux-66-features "Linux 6.6 Features Include The EEVDF Scheduler, Shadow Stack, Intel IVSC, AMD DBC & More")
  * [Btrfs For Linux 6.6 Brings Fixes, Partially Recovers From Scrub Performance Regression](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Btrfs-Linux-6.6 "Btrfs For Linux 6.6 Brings Fixes, Partially Recovers From Scrub Performance Regression") ‚Äî David Sterba of SUSE sent out the Btrfs updates on Monday for the Linux 6.6 kernel merge window. There are no explicit new features this cycle but a variety of bug fixes, including work to address the Btrfs scrub performance following a rework back in Linux 6.4. The scrub performance isn't entirely restored but at least it's inching ahead in the right direction with Linux 6.6.
  * [EXT4 Lands A Nice Performance Improvement For Appending To Delalloc Files](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.6-EXT4 "EXT4 Lands A Nice Performance Improvement For Appending To Delalloc Files") ‚Äî I conducted tests in my 32-core environment by launching 32 concurrent threads to append write to the same file. Each write operation had a length of 1024 bytes and was repeated 100000 times. Without using this patch, the test was completed in 7705 ms. However, with this patch, the test was completed in 5066 ms, resulting in a performance improvement of 34%.
  * [XFS File-System Maintainer Stepping Down](https://www.phoronix.com/news/XFS-Maintainer-Steps-Down "XFS File-System Maintainer Stepping Down") ‚Äî My final act as maintainer is to write down every thing that I've been doing as maintainer for the past six years. There are too many demands placed on the maintainer, and the only way to fix this is to delegate the responsibilities. I also wrote down my impressions of the unwritten rules about how to contribute to XFS.
  * [XFS Begins Landing Online Repair, New Release Manager Takes Over](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.6-XFS "XFS Begins Landing Online Repair, New Release Manager Takes Over") ‚Äî We now have in-memory pageable memory for staging btrees, a bunch of pending fixes, and we've started the process of refactoring the scrub support code to support more of repair.
  * [SELinux In Linux 6.6 Removes References To Its Origins At The US NSA](https://www.phoronix.com/news/SELinux-Drops-NSA-References "SELinux In Linux 6.6 Removes References To Its Origins At The US NSA") ‚Äî We've come a long way from the original NSA submission and I would consider SELinux a true community project at this point so removing the NSA branding just makes sense.
  * [Linux 6.6 To Bring Another Rust Toolchain Upgrade](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.6-Rust-Changes "Linux 6.6 To Bring Another Rust Toolchain Upgrade") ‚Äî Some of the other Rust changes for this imminent merge window include supporting the rust-analyzer for out-of-tree kernel modules, the Rust availability detection script has been improved, a new "paste!" proc macro, new pinned-init APIs, and a variety of other additions to continue to make Rust programming possibilities for the Linux kernel more robust.

  * [Soltros' Nix Config](https://github.com/soltros/nixconfigs/blob/main/desktop/configuration.nix "Soltros' Nix Config")
  * [SilverBullet](https://silverbullet.md/ "SilverBullet") ‚Äî SilverBullet is an extensible open-source, personal knowledge management system. Indeed, that‚Äôs fancy talk for ‚Äúa note-taking app with links.‚Äù However, SilverBullet goes a bit beyond just that.
  * [Nixpkgs supply chain security project](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nixpkgs-supply-chain-security-project/34345 "Nixpkgs supply chain security project") ‚Äî The focus of this project is on reducing our reliance on foreign binaries to compile Nixpkgs from scratch, ensuring we are are indeed running the code we compiled by leveraging existing security components in NixOS, and putting in place mechanisms that allow us to deliver the most up-to-date, secure software whenever it is available in a way that can be sustained given our maintainer capacities.
