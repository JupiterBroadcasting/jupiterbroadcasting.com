The RSS 2.0 spec was last updated in 2009 and there had been little to no activity to update RSS since then.
  * [Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace "Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace") — A wholistic rss namespace for podcasting that is meant to synthesize the fragmented world of podcast namespaces. The broad goal is to create a single, compact, efficient namespace that is easily extensible, community controlled/authored and addresses the needs of the independent podcast industry now and in the future. Our hope is that this namespace will become the framework that the independent podcast community needs to deliver new functionality to apps and aggregators.
