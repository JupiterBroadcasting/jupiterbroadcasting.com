### Episode Links

  * [Thelio Fan Noise Hack - Mike's Blog](http://dominickm.com/thelio-fan-noise-hack/ "Thelio Fan Noise Hack - Mike's Blog") — I’ve had a System 76 Thelio for a little over four months now and a consistent issue that I’ve been experiencing is persistent fan noise even when the machine is idle.
  * [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015 "Advent of Code 2015")
  * [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/ "Elixir") — Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems, while also being successfully used in web development and the embedded software domain. 
  * [Mike on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dominucco/status/1135308539944194048 "Mike on Twitter") — Someone tell @wespayne that I hate him ;) He introduced me to @elixirlang and it's like fast #Ruby. I think I might be hooked. Totally failed to get anything done though lol
  * [Elixir vs. Ruby and Phoenix vs. Rails: Detailed Comparison and Use Cases](https://mlsdev.com/blog/elixir-vs-ruby-and-phoenix-vs-rails-what-to-choose-and-why "Elixir vs. Ruby and Phoenix vs. Rails: Detailed Comparison and Use Cases") — If you are facing the Elixir vs. Ruby/Phoenix vs. Rails dilemma, the best way to decide is to cater to the needs of your project. In fact, it is even possible to use both technologies in one project by choosing which of them works best for each individual feature. For example, you can implement chats with Elixir Phoenix, and the rest of the code can be written in Ruby on Rails. 
  * [TypeScript - JavaScript that scales.](https://www.typescriptlang.org/ "TypeScript - JavaScript that scales.") — TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. 
  * [Why TypeScript · TypeScript Deep Dive](https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/docs/why-typescript.html "Why TypeScript · TypeScript Deep Dive") — Types have proven ability to enhance code quality and understandability. However, types have a way of being unnecessarily ceremonious. TypeScript is very particular about keeping the barrier to entry as low as possible. 
  * [Basic Types · TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html "Basic Types · TypeScript Handbook")
  * [TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/ "TypeScript Playground")
  * [microsoft/TypeScript-New-Handbook](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-New-Handbook "microsoft/TypeScript-New-Handbook") — Incubation repository for the new TypeScript handbook.
  * [Introduction - fp-ts](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/ "Introduction - fp-ts") — fp-ts provides developers with popular patterns and reliable abstractions from typed functional languages in TypeScript. 
  * [Purify](https://gigobyte.github.io/purify/ "Purify") — Functional programming library for TypeScript
  * [piotrwitek/utility-types](https://github.com/piotrwitek/utility-types "piotrwitek/utility-types") — Collection of utility types, complementing TypeScript built-in mapped types and aliases (think "lodash" for static types). 
  * [Solving Problems the Clojure Way - Rafal Dittwald](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK1DazRK_a0 "Solving Problems the Clojure Way - Rafal Dittwald") — After overcoming a fear of brackets, the next challenge for would-be Clojurians is less superficial: to stop writing Java (or Javascript, or Haskell...) with Clojure's syntax, and actually start "thinking" in Clojure. It is said that Clojure is a "functional" programming language; there's also talk of "data-driven" programming. What are these things? Are they any good? Why are they good? In this talk, Rafal attempts to distill the particular blend of functional and data-driven programming that makes up "idiomatic Clojure", clarify what it looks like in practise (with real-world examples), and reflect on how Clojure's conventions came to be and how they continue to evolve.
