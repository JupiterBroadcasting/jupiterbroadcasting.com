  * [The Krita community came to the rescue](https://krita.org/en/item/krita-foundation-update/ "The Krita community came to the rescue") — We didn’t expect the incredible response from all of you! A day later, over 500 awesome people have donated a total of €9562 (at the time of writing, check the fancy progress bar we’ve finally managed to create!).

  * [Some BLU phones still phoning home to China](https://liliputing.com/2017/07/amazon-sort-suspends-sales-blu-smartphones-due-securityprivacy-concerns.html "Some BLU phones still phoning home to China") — BLU released a software update to address the issue, but Kryptowire researchers told CNET recently that some BLU phones still are still running the offending software… and Amazon has responded by suspending sales of all BLU phone models until the issue is resolved
  * [Or are They?](https://liliputing.com/2017/08/blu-phones-return-to-amazon-following-privacy-scare.html "Or are They?") — The reason data is being sent to a Chines server is because BLU is using an over-the-air update service called Adups, which is based in China, and which allows some phone makers to request a lot of personal data from users’ phones. But after a related report from Kryptowire in 2016, BLU decided to start using Google’s OTA update service on newer devices.

Red Hat will not be moving Btrfs to a fully supported feature and it will be removed in a future major release of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
