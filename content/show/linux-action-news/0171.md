  * [LTS versions of Qt going closed-source](https://www.theregister.com/2021/01/05/qt_lts_goes_commercial_only/ "LTS versions of Qt going closed-source") — The Qt Company is making LTS releases commercial only and thus closed-source. "The problem is that these releases are in effect no longer maintained. If there is a security issue, or a fix needed to support some change in one of the target operating systems, open-source users will not get that fix other than in the not-ready version 6.0."
  * [QT 5.15 Commercial-only LTS phase starts: Closing the 5.15 branch(es) on 5th January : linux](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/kqi1v8/qt_515_commercialonly_lts_phase_starts_closing/?utm_name=iossmf "QT 5.15 Commercial-only LTS phase starts: Closing the 5.15 branch\(es\) on 5th January : linux")

  * [A shell UX update – GNOME Shell & Mutter](https://blogs.gnome.org/shell-dev/2021/01/07/a-shell-ux-update "A shell UX update – GNOME Shell & Mutter") — The new design has prompted a lot of interest and comment, which we’re all really thrilled about. In this post I wanted to provide an update of where the initiative is at. I also want to take the opportunity to answer some of the common questions that have come up. 
  * [Progress On The GNOME 40 Shell Continues At Full Speed - Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=GNOME-Shell-40-January-Progress "Progress On The GNOME 40 Shell Continues At Full Speed - Phoronix")
  * [Dissecting the Apple M1 GPU, part I](https://rosenzweig.io/blog/asahi-gpu-part-1.html "Dissecting the Apple M1 GPU, part I") — A few weeks ago, I purchased a Mac Mini with an M1 GPU as a development target to study the instruction set and command stream, to understand the GPU’s architecture at a level not previously publicly understood, and ultimately to accelerate the development of a Mesa driver for the hardware. Today I’ve reached my first milestone: I now understand enough of the instruction set to disassemble simple shaders with a free and open-source tool chain, released on GitHub.
  * [Early Work Is Underway On Reverse-Engineering The Apple M1 GPU](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Apple-M1-GPU-RE "Early Work Is Underway On Reverse-Engineering The Apple M1 GPU")
  * [NVIDIA getting geared up to support hardware accelerated XWayland](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/01/nvidia-getting-geared-up-to-support-hardware-accelerated-xwayland "NVIDIA getting geared up to support hardware accelerated XWayland") — NVIDIA’s Erik Kurzinger has submitted a Merge Request to the xserver GitLab titled “Xwayland: Support hardware accelerated rendering with the proprietary NVIDIA driver”, with the two patches included “intended to accompany upcoming support in the proprietary NVIDIA driver for hardware accelerated GL and Vulkan rendering with Xwayland”. Kurzinger continues to mention that once a driver is out with the needed hooks, this code should “just start working”.
  * [NVIDIA Prepares XWayland OpenGL/Vulkan Acceleration Support](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NVIDIA-GL-VLK-XWayland "NVIDIA Prepares XWayland OpenGL/Vulkan Acceleration Support")

  * [PeerTube v3: it’s a live, a liiiiive ! – Framablog](https://framablog.org/2021/01/07/peertube-v3-its-a-live-a-liiiiive/ "PeerTube v3: it’s a live, a liiiiive ! – Framablog") — Today we are releasing a major new version of PeerTube, our alternative to centralized video platforms like YouTube.
