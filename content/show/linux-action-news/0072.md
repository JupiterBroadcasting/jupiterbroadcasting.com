  * [Google loosens grasp on AMP](https://amphtml.wordpress.com/2018/09/18/governance/ "Google loosens grasp on AMP") — we want to move to a model that explicitly gives a voice to all constituents of the community, including those who cannot contribute code themselves, such as end-users. The change we are proposing is based on months of research, through which we’ve decided to follow the lead of the Node.js project and move to a consensus-seeking governance model.
