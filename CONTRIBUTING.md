Firstly, thank you for being here! We appreciate you.

A few items captured here for now, with welcome additions:

### Lets Be Efficient!
Top priority is to hopefully avoid using anyone's time/effort - including yours! - on items that may eventually not be used. We want to spend time/effort on things that get implemented! 
Thus it's good practice to get consult first on a new grand idea you may have, and obtain context on the greater vision before beginning work to make sure you can implement in the way that ends up best for all the moving pieces. Often these discussion end up very, very fascinating and land us in elegant solutions we could not have predicted.

### Discussions via Matrix
Our base of operations for group discussions on this project: [Jupiter Web Site on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#jupiterweb:jupiterbroadcasting.com)

### What to work on?
Q:
> I'm just cloning the repo and setting stuff up. Is there a particular ticket/ticket set I might be able to help with specifically ? Or just float around unassigned issues?

A:
> so far we've been operating on the following principles:
> 
> * collect ideas and features and tasks via tickets
> * the current Milestone defines our priorites for website launch - concentrate here first
> * when you feel inspired about a particular ticket or feature, please propose your implementation idea/strategy for approval via  comments, which also indicates you are dedicated to solving this issue, thus avoiding duplication of effort.
> * if you have a particular skillset, feel free to focus there.
> * some tickets are specifically labeled "low priority", but others are so far of fairly equal importance. Anytime there is something clearly urgent, the "urgent" tag will be used.

### Issue assignment for work in progress
* Note: currently non-organisation members cannot self-assign.

Q:
> Since I’ve not worked with a team using git/GitHub, is the etiquette to assign a issue to ourselves if we are working on it or just comment on the issue saying we are working on it?

A:
> the key is to communicate enough to avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts, which has already happened unfortunately.
>
> So, if you want to tackle a particular ticket feel free to assign yourself (if that's within your ability) or otherwise comment to signal your intentions and interest. the important thing is to communicate your intention, and progress so we can help you find success. And, as we've seen already: it seems like when there's movement on a ticket we all get inspired aswell. Progress is wonderfully contagious!

### PRs, work in progress
> I'd also advise not to be shy about pushing PRs as you work, just mark them as Work In Progress (WIP)


### Branch cleanup on PR merges

> You can feel free to delete your feature branch right away after a merged the PR. There’s a button handy on the GitHub interface, and worst case they can be reverted easily.

Other than that - have fun!
