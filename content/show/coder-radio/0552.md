  * [DHH on X](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1742193541999112308 "DHH on X") ‚Äî We have some great, native, dedicated apps ready for HEY Calendar. The Android one is just sitting there waiting for us to push publish in the Google Play Store. Guess what's happening to the other one for iOS? Still "in review" since mid December üôÑ
  * [DHH on X](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1742638740525187506 "DHH on X") ‚Äî Ah @apple, not this shit again. I thought we sorted it out 2.5 years ago in round one?! Why oh why must it be like this! You know we're not just going to roll over, that we're never going to pay the 30% ransom. Just approve the fucking app and we'll be on our merry way!

  * [Tim Sweeney on X](https://twitter.com/timsweeneyepic/status/1743389878589542566 "Tim Sweeney on X") ‚Äî Fortnite, but not on iOS because you are blocking it from a billion users.
  * [Apple‚Äôs rejection of Hey calendar app renews an old fight](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/5/24027283/apple-hey-rejection-calendar-app-basecamp-david-heinemeier-hansson "Apple‚Äôs rejection of Hey calendar app renews an old fight") ‚Äî Basecamp founder and app creator David Heinemeier Hansson referred to Apple‚Äôs decision as ‚Äúbullying tactics.‚Äù

No. But we also don‚Äôt want to leave our customers with iPhones waiting for our awesome native HEY Calendar app.
  * [DHH on X](https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1744745276932604413 "DHH on X") ‚Äî Apple approved the HEY Calendar!! It's now available for download in the @appstore . Ridiculous it needed this level of awareness/pressure, but I'm so happy for our iOS team to see their work through the weekend pay off in full. Thanks to all who cheered!
  * [The New York Times Sues Microsoft, OpenAI for Copyright Infringement](https://www.thurrott.com/a-i/295251/the-new-york-times-sues-microsoft-openai-for-copyright-infringement "The New York Times Sues Microsoft, OpenAI for Copyright Infringement") ‚Äî The New York Times has sued Microsoft and OpenAI for copyright infringement and is seeking ‚Äúbillions of dollars in statutory and actual damages.‚Äù
  * [Amazon's Silent Sacking](https://justingarrison.com/blog/2023-12-30-amazons-silent-sacking/ "Amazon's Silent Sacking") ‚Äî In 2023 Amazon laid off more than 27,000 people.

  * [Should You Watch Babylon 5? : startrek](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/g6875/should_you_watch_babylon_5/ "Should You Watch Babylon 5? : startrek") ‚Äî Babylon 5 is basically the anti-Trek. More specifically, it's the anti-TNG. The Earth Alliance isn't a magic utopia, it's the exact government you would expect modern boneheaded American politicians to set up if they suddenly landed in 2250.
