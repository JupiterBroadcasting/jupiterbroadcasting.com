  * [NVIDIA Releases Open-Source GPU Kernel Modules ](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-releases-open-source-gpu-kernel-modules/ "NVIDIA Releases Open-Source GPU Kernel Modules ") — This release is a significant step toward improving the experience of using NVIDIA GPUs in Linux, for tighter integration with the OS and for developers to debug, integrate, and contribute back.
  * [NVIDIA Transitioning To Official, Open-Source Linux GPU Kernel Driver](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=nvidia-open-kernel&num=1 "NVIDIA Transitioning To Official, Open-Source Linux GPU Kernel Driver") — NVIDIA's open kernel modules is already considered "production ready, opt-in" for data center GPUs. For GeForce and workstation GPUs, the open kernel module code is considered "alpha quality" but will be ramped up moving forward with future releases.
