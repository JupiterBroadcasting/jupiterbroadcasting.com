  * [Linux has been bitten by its most high-severity vulnerability in years](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/03/linux-has-been-bitten-by-its-most-high-severity-vulnerability-in-years/ "Linux has been bitten by its most high-severity vulnerability in years") — Dirty Pipe has the potential to smudge people using Linux and Linux derivitives.
  * [Catalin Cimpanu on Twitter](https://twitter.com/campuscodi/status/1500847226083549186 "Catalin Cimpanu on Twitter") — “DirtyPipe (CVE-2022-0847) is a vulnerability in the Linux kernel since 5.8 which allows overwriting data in arbitrary read-only files. This leads to privilege escalation. It is similar to CVE-2016-5195 “Dirty Cow” but is easier to exploit. 
  * [Ron Amadeo on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ronamadeo/status/1501055320973533187 "Ron Amadeo on Twitter") — “By my count, Dirty Pipe affects only brand-new Android 12 devices like the Pixel 6 and S22. Linux 5.8 and above has only been an Android option for five months."

  * [Introducing Native Matrix VoIP with Element Call!](https://element.io/blog/introducing-native-matrix-voip-with-element-call/ "Introducing Native Matrix VoIP with Element Call!") — What’s more, Element Call is built entirely on Matrix: it doesn’t need any additional servers to get going. You can run it against your existing Matrix homeserver to provide complete self-sovereignty… while still being able to talk to anyone else anywhere on the wider Matrix network! We will also be able to automatically use Matrix’s end-to-end encryption to secure all Element Call conferences
