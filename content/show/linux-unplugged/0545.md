  * [Boltz](https://boltz.exchange/ "Boltz") â€” Privacy First, Non-Custodial Bitcoin Exchange.
  * [bcachefs](https://bcachefs.org/ "bcachefs") â€” bcachefs is an advanced new filesystem for Linux, with an emphasis on reliability and robustness and the complete set of features one would expect from a modern filesystem. 
  * [bcachefs Erasure coding](https://bcachefs.org/ErasureCoding/ "bcachefs Erasure coding") â€” Bcachefs takes advantage of the fact that it is already a copy-on-write filesystem. If we're designing our filesystem to avoid update-in-place, why would we do update-in-place in our RAID implementation?
  * [bcachefs Caching](https://bcachefs.org/Caching/ "bcachefs Caching") â€” bcachefs can be configured for writethrough, writeback, and writearound caching, as well as other more specialized setups. 
  * [bachefs Compression](https://bcachefs.org/Compression/ "bachefs Compression") â€” Unlike other filesystems that typically do compression at the block level, bcachefs does compression at the extent level - variable size chunks, up to (by default) 128k.
  * [bcachefs Encryption](https://bcachefs.org/Encryption/ "bcachefs Encryption") â€” bcachefs uses AEAD style encryption (ChaCha20/Poly1305), where each encrypted block is authenticated with a MAC, with a chain of trust up to root (the superblock), and every encrypted block has a unique nonce. 
  * [bcachefs Snapshots](https://bcachefs.org/Snapshots/ "bcachefs Snapshots") â€” bcachefs provides Btrfs style writeable snapshots, at subvolume granularity. 
  * [(2015) [ANNOUNCE] bcachefs - a general purpose COW filesystem](https://lkml.org/lkml/2015/8/21/22 "\(2015\) \[ANNOUNCE\] bcachefs - a general purpose COW filesystem") â€” It's taken a long time to get to this point - longer than I would have guessed if you'd asked me back when we first started talking about it - but I'm pretty damn proud of where it's at now.
