  * [Or are They?](https://liliputing.com/2017/08/blu-phones-return-to-amazon-following-privacy-scare.html "Or are They?") — The reason data is being sent to a Chines server is because BLU is using an over-the-air update service called Adups, which is based in China, and which allows some phone makers to request a lot of personal data from users’ phones. But after a related report from Kryptowire in 2016, BLU decided to start using Google’s OTA update service on newer devices.
