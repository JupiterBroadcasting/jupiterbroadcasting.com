This, in turn, allows a hacker to crash systemd and hence the entire operating system.

But just how far have they come? Let's do a little reminiscing.
  * [The Framework Laptop is now shipping, and press reviews](https://frame.work/ca/en/blog/the-framework-laptop-is-now-shipping-and-press-reviews "The Framework Laptop is now shipping, and press reviews") — We’re excited to see the first press reviews go live for the Framework Laptop and the first orders land on your doorsteps today!
