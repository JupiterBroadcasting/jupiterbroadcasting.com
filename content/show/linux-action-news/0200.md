  * [linux-block - Linux 5.x block layer tree(s)](https://git.kernel.dk/cgit/linux-block/commit/?h=for-5.15/block&id=c4ef8f85faceea73154e63746108b85fb70ec6b1 "linux-block - Linux 5.x block layer tree\(s\)")

  * [Microsoft: Component Shortages Not Going Away Any Time Soon](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2021-Q4/press-release-webcast "Microsoft: Component Shortages Not Going Away Any Time Soon") — Supply-chain pressures also will continue to impact Microsoft's Xbox gaming consoles and PCs made by its partners, company officials conceded. Hood told analysts to expect Windows OEM revenues in Q1 FY22 to decline mid to high single digits and Surface revenue to decline by low teens.
  * [Mozilla VPN unveils major security boost](https://www.techradar.com/news/mozilla-vpn-unveils-major-security-boost "Mozilla VPN unveils major security boost") — Split tunneling is now available in Mozilla VPN on iOS and Android.
  * [Steam Beta Brings New Downloads Page, Linux Container Updates](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Steam-Beta-29-July-2021 "Steam Beta Brings New Downloads Page, Linux Container Updates") — This Steam beta update is a bit meatier than normal with a new downloads page implementation, several Linux-specific updates.
  * [Steam Community :: Group :: Steam Client Beta](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/2974049913511655206 "Steam Community :: Group :: Steam Client Beta")
  * [Chrome OS persistent desk bar receives a vital pre-release fix](https://chromeunboxed.com/bento-persistent-desk-bar-improvements "Chrome OS persistent desk bar receives a vital pre-release fix") — Last month, the Chrome OS development team decided that virtual desks weren’t being used enough by well, practically anyone, so they created what’s called Bento – or the ‘Persistent Desk Bar’.

Owning a cable, as opposed to renting one, secures a company’s control of the traffic on the cable and ensures the company can serve its clients first before sharing traffic with its competitors.
  * [How Hyperscale Cloud Platforms Reshaped the Submarine Cable Industry](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/networks/how-hyperscale-cloud-platforms-are-reshaping-submarine-cable-industry "How Hyperscale Cloud Platforms Reshaped the Submarine Cable Industry") — For a lot more on how hyperscalers are changing the game in the world of submarine cables, listen to our interview with TeleGeography’s Alan Mauldin in full on The Data Center Podcast.
