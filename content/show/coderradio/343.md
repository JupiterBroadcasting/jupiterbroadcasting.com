  * [Apple bans Facebook’s Research app that paid users for data](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/apple-bans-facebook-vpn/ "Apple bans Facebook’s Research app that paid users for data")
  * [Apple restores Google’s own internal iPhone apps after privacy brouhaha](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/02/in-addition-to-facebooks-apple-restores-googles-ios-app-certificate/ "Apple restores Google’s own internal iPhone apps after privacy brouhaha") — For less than a day, Apple had briefly revoked Google’s iOS certificate that enabled those private apps to conduct various internal business such as company shuttles, food menus, as well as pre-release beta testing, and more. 
  * [Apple Developer Enterprise Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enterprise/ "Apple Developer Enterprise Program") — Get tools and resources to transform your mobile workforce with enterprise-class apps, distributed seamlessly and securely within your organization. 
  * [Apple Is Fighting a Good Fight Against Facebook and Google](https://medium.com/s/story/apple-is-fighting-a-good-fight-against-facebook-and-google-cd39b8a6b733 "Apple Is Fighting a Good Fight Against Facebook and Google") — The implication that Apple is exhibiting some monopolistic urge to gutshot Facebook and Google makes close to zero sense. The events of this week will not affect their bottom lines, and Apple could have taken much more drastic action to lock down iOS — as it has before.
  * [Nilay Patel on Twitter](https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1090696656855728129 "Nilay Patel on Twitter") — Hi, I'm the nagging voice in the back of your head pointing out that it's pretty intense that Apple can simply decide to prevent people from running code on their phones.
  * [Essential .NET - C# 8.0 and Nullable Reference Types](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt829270.aspx "Essential .NET - C# 8.0 and Nullable Reference Types") — Nonetheless, as it currently stands, and even after 7 versions of C#, we still don’t have a perfect language.
  * [Make your next C# project non-nullable](http://blog.hovland.xyz/2019-01-15-make-your-next-csharp-project-non-nullable/ "Make your next C# project non-nullable") — The naming is a bit confusing, because reference types have always been nullable, and that’s the whole problem. The novelty is that they can now also be non-nullable.
  * [Switch to errors instead of warnings for nullable reference types in C# 8](https://www.tabsoverspaces.com/233764-switch-to-errors-instead-of-warnings-for-nullable-reference-types-in-csharp-8 "Switch to errors instead of warnings for nullable reference types in C# 8") — Nullable reference types coming in C# 8 are a great addition to anyone’s toolbox. But if you tried it you probably know “just” warnings are produced. And sometimes you’d like to have errors instead of warnings, so the build fails hard or something like that. It’s surprisingly easy to do so.
