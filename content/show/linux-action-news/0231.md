  * [Catalin Cimpanu on Twitter](https://twitter.com/campuscodi/status/1500847226083549186 "Catalin Cimpanu on Twitter") ‚Äî ‚ÄúDirtyPipe (CVE-2022-0847) is a vulnerability in the Linux kernel since 5.8 which allows overwriting data in arbitrary read-only files. This leads to privilege escalation. It is similar to CVE-2016-5195 ‚ÄúDirty Cow‚Äù but is easier to exploit. 
  * [Ron Amadeo on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ronamadeo/status/1501055320973533187 "Ron Amadeo on Twitter") ‚Äî ‚ÄúBy my count, Dirty Pipe affects only brand-new Android 12 devices like the Pixel 6 and S22. Linux 5.8 and above has only been an Android option for five months."

  * [Introducing Native Matrix VoIP with Element Call!](https://element.io/blog/introducing-native-matrix-voip-with-element-call/ "Introducing Native Matrix VoIP with Element Call!") ‚Äî What‚Äôs more, Element Call is built entirely on Matrix: it doesn‚Äôt need any additional servers to get going. You can run it against your existing Matrix homeserver to provide complete self-sovereignty‚Ä¶ while still being able to talk to anyone else anywhere on the wider Matrix network! We will also be able to automatically use Matrix‚Äôs end-to-end encryption to secure all Element Call conferences
