  * [Andres Freund on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@AndresFreundTec/112180406142695845 "Andres Freund on Mastodon") â€” I was doing some micro-benchmarking at the time, needed to quiesce the system to reduce noise. Saw sshd processes were using a surprising amount of CPU, despite immediately failing because of wrong usernames etc....
  * [rwmj on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39865810 "rwmj on Hacker News") â€” Very annoying - the apparent author of the backdoor was in communication with me over several weeks trying to get xz 5.6.x added to Fedora 40 &amp; 41 because of its &quot;great new features&quot;
  * [A Microcosm of the interactions in Open Source projects](https://robmensching.com/blog/posts/2024/03/30/a-microcosm-of-the-interactions-in-open-source-projects/ "A Microcosm of the interactions in Open Source projects") â€” Make no mistake. This is the way it works. It needs to change.

  * [Ryan C. Gordon on X](https://twitter.com/icculus/status/1774310925035524333 "Ryan C. Gordon on X") â€” This is probably how the xz thing happened, right?
  * [Jan Wildeboer on the Fediverse](https://social.wildeboer.net/@jwildeboer/112184074379919145 "Jan Wildeboer on the Fediverse") â€” Again the FOSS world has proven to be vigilant and proactive in finding bugs and backdoors, IMHO.
