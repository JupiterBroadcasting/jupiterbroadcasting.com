  * [Farewell, application menus!](https://blogs.gnome.org/aday/2018/10/09/farewell-application-menus/ "Farewell, application menus!") — These menus have been with us since the beginning of the GNOME 3.0 series, but we’re planning on retiring them for the next GNOME release (version 3.32).

  * [Andy Grover (@iamagrover)](https://twitter.com/iamagrover "Andy Grover \(@iamagrover\)") — Hacks on @StratisStorage at Red Hat, and has other creative dreams too. Bass. Rustlang. Mostly cat and political retweets these days.

  * [Stratis: Easy local storage management for Linux [LWN.net]](https://lwn.net/Articles/755454/ "Stratis: Easy local storage management for Linux \[LWN.net\]") — Stratis is a new local storage-management solution for Linux. It can be compared to ZFS, Btrfs, or LVM. Its focus is on simplicity of concepts and ease of use, while giving users access to advanced storage features. Internally, Stratis's implementation favors tight integration of existing components instead of the fully-integrated, in-kernel approach that ZFS and Btrfs use. 
  * [XFS vs EXT4 – Comparing MongoDB Performance on AWS EC2](https://scalegrid.io/blog/xfs-vs-ext4-comparing-mongodb-performance-on-aws-ec2/ "XFS vs EXT4 – Comparing MongoDB Performance on AWS EC2") — In performance terms, XFS is indeed a force multiplier when paired with high speed disks that it can take real advantage from. For low to mid-end systems, it doesn’t seem to be able to do much to improve your performance.
