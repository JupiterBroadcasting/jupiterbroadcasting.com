bio: 'Matthias Kirschner is President of the Free Software Foundation Europe. In 1999
  he started using GNU/Linux and realised that software is deeply involved in all
  aspects of our lives. Matthias is convinced that this technology has to empower
  society not restrict it. While studying Political and Administrative Science he
  joined FSFE in 2004.

  He helps other organisations, companies and governments to understand how they can
  benefit from Free Software -- which gives everybody the rights to use, understand,
  adapt, and share software -- and how those rights help to support freedom of speech,
  freedom of press or privacy.'
