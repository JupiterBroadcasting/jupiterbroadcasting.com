We can also make various tweaks on top of that runtime to enforce ABI compatibility where it might be missing. 
  * [AAC will be supported in Fedora Workstation 27](https://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2017/10/12/aac-support-will-be-available-in-fedora-workstation-27/ "AAC will be supported in Fedora Workstation 27") — What we will be shipping in Fedora is a modified version of the AAC implementation released by Google, which was originally written by Frauenhoffer. On top of that we will of course be providing GStreamer plugins to enable full support for playing and creating AAC files for GStreamer applications.
  * [Plasma 5.11 released](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.11.0.php "Plasma 5.11 released") — Plasma 5.11 brings a redesigned settings app, improved notifications, a more powerful task manager.

  * [5.12 aims for Wayland improvements](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Plasma-5.12-Wayland-Release "5.12 aims for Wayland improvements") — If we all just use Wayland and report and fix the bugs we run into I'm sure that 5.12 will be an awesome release on Wayland. So please help to make it happen! 
  * [KDE turns 21](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=KDE-21-Years-Old "KDE turns 21") — t was on 14 October 1996 that the "Kool Desktop Environment" was founded by Matthias Ettrich. At the time he wanted KDE to be a "consistent, nice looking free desktop-environment."
