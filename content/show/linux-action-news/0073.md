  * [Android turns 10](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/23/history-of-android-the-good-the-bad-the-nexus/ "Android turns 10") — This was an era in which Android devices were responding to Apple, and not vice versa as we find today.
  * [Google's Project Zero criticises Linux distros for tardy kernel patches](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-project-zero-to-linux-distros-your-sluggish-kernel-patching-puts-users-at-risk/ "Google's Project Zero criticises Linux distros for tardy kernel patches") — Project Zero accuses Linux distributions of leaving users exposed to known kernel vulnerabilities for weeks.
  * [CVE-2018-17182 in Ubuntu](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2018/CVE-2018-17182.html "CVE-2018-17182 in Ubuntu") — As of 2018-09-26, fixes for this issue are applied to all kernels uploaded to RELEASE-proposed today. and should be released around Monday, Oct 1, 2018.
  * [No, GPL can't be revoked](https://lwn.net/Articles/766784/ "No, GPL can't be revoked") — For anybody who has been concerned by the talk from a few outsiders about revoking GPL licensing, this new section in the Software Freedom Conservancy's copyleft guide is worth a read. Thus, anyone downstream of the contributor (which is anyone using the contributor’s code), has an irrevocable license from the contributor. A contributor may claim to revoke their grant, and subsequently sue for copyright infringement, but a court would likely find the revocation was ineffective and the downstream user had a valid license defense to a claim of infringement. 
  * [KDE neon Rebased on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://dot.kde.org/2018/09/26/kde-neon-rebased-ubuntu-1804-lts-bionic-beaver "KDE neon Rebased on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS") — The KDE neon team is proud to announce the rebase of our packages onto Ubuntu 18.04 LTS "Bionic Beaver".

  * [At least half of Azure is running Linux](https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-now-dominates-azure/ "At least half of Azure is running Linux") — "it's about half now, but it varies on the day because a lot of these workloads are elastic, but sometimes slightly over half of Azure VMs are Linux." Microsoft later clarified, "about half Azure VMs are Linux."
  * [Firefox can now tell you when you get pwned](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/25/mozillas-firefox-monitor-will-now-alert-you-when-one-of-your-accounts-was-hacked/ "Firefox can now tell you when you get pwned") — Mozilla is taking this a step further by also letting you sign up for alerts for when your accounts appear in any (known) breaches in the future.
  * [Mintcast needs new hosts](https://mintcast.org/2018/09/26/mintcast-292-mint-and-podcast-news/ "Mintcast needs new hosts") — Rob and Isaac talk about ending their time doing the podcast and ask who would like to take over.
