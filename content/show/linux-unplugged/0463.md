  * [Brunch with Brent: Quentin Stafford-Fraser - Jupiter Extras](https://extras.show/86 "Brunch with Brent: Quentin Stafford-Fraser - Jupiter Extras") — Brent sits down with Dr Quentin Stafford-Fraser, computer scientist, serial-entrepreneur, inventor (perhaps) of the webcam, Augmented Reality Ph.D. who ran the very first web server at the University of Cambridge, among much more. We explore topics including computer science as an art-form, the origins of the Raspberry Pi and T9 predictive text, philosophies around innovation and invention, challenging the patent system, and more.
  * [JB London Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/jupiterbroadcasting/events/286056077/ "JB London Meetup")
  * [DNS Toys](https://www.dns.toys/ "DNS Toys") — A DNS server that takes creative liberties with the DNS protocol to offer handy utilities and services that are easily accessible via the command line.
  * [Mars helicopter needs patch to work around failed sensor](https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/07/ingenuity_patch/ "Mars helicopter needs patch to work around failed sensor") — The patch inserts a small code snippet into the software running on Ingenuity's flight computer, intercepting incoming garbage packets from the inclinometer and injecting replacement packets constructed from IMU data.

We went back to the drawing board to design a completely new homepage, a refreshed UI with beautifully crafted glass-like elements, a new dock-based layout, and the option to pick and choose from one of the 16 gorgeous, hand-curated wallpapers. And, of course, there’s a dark mode.
