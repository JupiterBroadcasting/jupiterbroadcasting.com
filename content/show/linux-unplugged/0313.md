You Can Download Them Free](https://news.slashdot.org/story/19/08/06/1723220/millions-of-books-are-secretly-in-the-public-domain-you-can-download-them-free?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed "Millions of Books Are Secretly in the Public Domain. You Can Download Them Free") — Prior to 1964, books had a 28-year copyright term. Extending it required authors or publishers to send in a separate form, and lots of people didn't end up doing that. Thanks to the efforts of the New York Public Library, many of those public domain books are now free online.
  * [About FreeOffice - it's not being installed by default - Announcements - Manjaro Linux Forum](https://forum.manjaro.org/t/about-freeoffice-its-not-being-installed-by-default/97297 "About FreeOffice - it's not being installed by default - Announcements - Manjaro Linux Forum") — Manjaro will not be installing FreeOffice by default. This isn't happening.
  * [Join the new Minimization Team - devel-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/KJ25KBVKZMG7JYJMBPOEHWYG5BD63L4P/ "Join the new Minimization Team - devel-announce - Fedora Mailing-Lists") — I'm starting a Minimization Objective focusing on minimising the installation size of some of the popular apps, runtimes, and other pieces of software in Fedora.
  * [Google Engineers Get Windows Booting When Kexec'ed Under Linux - Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Google-Kexec-Windows-Linux "Google Engineers Get Windows Booting When Kexec'ed Under Linux - Phoronix") — An interesting summer internship at Google has led to an experimental effort to get Microsoft Windows running via Kexec from Linux. The engineers involved have been implementing enough of the EFI Boot Services to be able to kexec Windows from Linux. 
  * [Roy Hopkins on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rd_hopkins/status/1154888315092557824 "Roy Hopkins on Twitter") — That's a coincidence. Today I managed to boot Windows 10 directly from Linux on a real platform using a kernel module to emulate UEFI. I hate to say it but achieving ExitBootServices is only the beginning... 
  * [LinuxBoot](https://www.linuxboot.org/ "LinuxBoot") — LinuxBoot is a firmware for modern servers that replaces specific firmware functionality like the UEFI DXE phase with a Linux kernel and runtime.

  * [Benchmarking the Raspberry Pi 4 - Gareth Halfacree](https://medium.com/@ghalfacree/benchmarking-the-raspberry-pi-4-73e5afbcd54b "Benchmarking the Raspberry Pi 4 - Gareth Halfacree") — Although appearing similar at first glance, the new board is slightly larger thanks to ports extending further from the PCB for improved case compatibility, the Ethernet and USB ports have been switched around, the power input is now a USB Type-C connector, and the full-size HDMI output has been swapped out for not one but two micro-HDMI connectors.

Built on HackMD source code, CodiMD lets you host and control your team's content with speed and ease. 
  * [r-darwish/topgrade: Upgrade everything](https://github.com/r-darwish/topgrade "r-darwish/topgrade: Upgrade everything") — Keeping your system up to date mostly involves invoking more than a single package manager. This usually results in big shell one-liners saved in your shell history. Topgrade tries to solve this problem by detecting which tools you use and run their appropriate package managers.
