  * [ðŸ‘‹ Hello, GitHub | @natfriedman](https://natfriedman.github.io/hello/ "ðŸ‘‹ Hello, GitHub | @natfriedman") â€” Who am I? My name is Nat and Iâ€™ve been a developer since I was six. Iâ€™ve been active in open source since the 90s when I discovered Linux. I was blown away to discover a free operating system that came with an editor, compiler, and debuggerâ€”all of the tools you need to be a developer, and all of the source code! It was an incredible opportunity for a teenager in a small town in Virginia to learn from the best developers in the world. I spent 15 years working with Linux and founded a couple of open source companies. My first commit to GitHub was in 2009, when GitHub was a year old.
