  * [Linux 6.2 Power-Savings While Idle Or Lightly Loaded](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Lazy-RCU-Likely-For-Linux-6.2 "Linux 6.2 Power-Savings While Idle Or Lightly Loaded") ‚Äî The short story for Linux end-users is the Lazy RCU work can provide 5~10% power-savings for idle or lightly-loaded systems by this lazy/batching functionality.
  * [Linux 6.2 Picking Up Mainline Support For Apple M1 Pro/Max/Ultra Hardware](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-62-Apple-M1-Pro-Max-Ultra "Linux 6.2 Picking Up Mainline Support For Apple M1 Pro/Max/Ultra Hardware") ‚Äî This gets the high-end Mac Studio systems with those premium SoCs now compatible with the mainline kernel.
  * [Hector's Deleted Tweet](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1587010094197506048 "Hector's Deleted Tweet") ‚Äî I'm getting tired of arguing with kernel maintainers. The other day I spent 6 hours arguing on IRC about what should've been a 30 minute fix patch.
  * [Hector Martin on Twitter Follow Up Tweet](https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1587011361753960448 "Hector Martin on Twitter Follow Up Tweet") ‚Äî Like dude, if you aren't going to step into my world and actually understand what I'm trying to do here, just suck it up and ack my patch. It is not my job to drag you kicking and screaming until you either give up or have a lightbulb moment.
  * [Seems some Kernel Maintainers Noticed the Twitter Rant](https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1587285684800606208 "Seems some Kernel Maintainers Noticed the Twitter Rant") ‚Äî Well they saw my tweets and apparently didn't like them ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

  * [FreeBSD Re-Introduces WireGuard Support Into Its Kernel](https://www.phoronix.com/news/FreeBSD-WireGuard-Lands-2022 "FreeBSD Re-Introduces WireGuard Support Into Its Kernel") ‚Äî As of Friday, a new WireGuard driver implementation has been re-introduced with many fixes/improvements over the code state from 2020.
  * [Open Letter to Gitea - Restoring Trust in the Gitea Project](https://gitea-open-letter.coding.social/ "Open Letter to Gitea - Restoring Trust in the Gitea Project") ‚Äî This unfortunately concludes the Gitea Open Letter has failed and there is no alternative but forking the project under a new name, with a healthy democratic governance.
