  * [HTC One review | BGR](http://bgr.com/2013/04/01/htc-one-review-401858/index.html)

> The HTC One is the best Android smartphone in the world — period. It
> combines some of the best materials with the most incredible screen I've
> seen, and is the fastest and most responsive Android phone I have used.

> I can boil the preceding 3,000 or so words into a few brief sentiments for
> you to chew on: the HTC One is easily the best device that the company has
> ever crafted, and it's perhaps the single nicest Android phone I've ever
> used. Despite some minor faults, I haven't so much as picked up any of the

> One unless I absolutely had to. It's really that good.

> The phone — like all phones — does have its shortcomings. There's no way to
> expand the storage, which HTC attempts to address by shipping the base model
> with 32 gigabytes of memory instead of the more standard 16 gigabytes.
> There's also no way to replace the battery. The power button on the top left
> of the phone is set at a bit of a downward angle that forces your finger to
> curl up and over the top edge of the phone in order to access it, which
> makes waking the phone up a tad cumbersome at times. And people with small
> hands may still find the 4.7-in.-screened handset too large to use
> comfortably.
