  * [The Linux Foundation and Harvard’s Lab for Innovation Science release census for open-source software security](https://lwn.net/Articles/812781/#Comments "The Linux Foundation and Harvard’s Lab for Innovation Science release census for open-source software security") — Census II (run by Harvard) wanted to look at language-level packages. Their report discusses some of the challenges. One challenge of many is that the JavaScript environment strongly encourages tiny modules, with around 1/2 of all JavaScript packages having at most one function. As a result, when you start counting dependencies, there are *far* more dependencies in JavaScript (because each module does so little), and so JavaScript tends to dominate.
