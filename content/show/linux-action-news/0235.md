  * [Docker rebounds with $105m Series C funding and $2.1b value ](https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/31/docker_funding_unicorn/ "Docker rebounds with $105m Series C funding and $2.1b value ") — Troubled container company may escape confines of its doldrums
  * [LXD 5.0 LTS has been released](https://discuss.linuxcontainers.org/t/lxd-5-0-lts-has-been-released/13723 "LXD 5.0 LTS has been released") — This is our 4th LTS release and quite an exciting one for anyone coming from LXD 4.0 as it significantly steps up LXD’s abilities, especially when operating in clustered environments.
  * [Anaconda is getting a new suit and a wizard](https://communityblog.fedoraproject.org/anaconda-is-getting-a-new-suit-and-a-wizard/ "Anaconda is getting a new suit and a wizard") — Before starting the redesign work for the Anaconda installer, the team reviewed user feedback and usability study data that we’ve gathered over the years. 
  * [Fedora Workstation Brainstorming A Possible GUI-Based Linux Recovery Environment](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Fedora-GUI-Based-Linux-Recovery "Fedora Workstation Brainstorming A Possible GUI-Based Linux Recovery Environment") — This currently hypothetical GUI-driven recovery environment sounds like it could almost be like Apple's macOS recovery mode in that there may be the possibility of even downloading a new system image from this environment.
  * [Fwupd 1.7.7 Released For Firmware Updating More Logitech Devices On Linux - Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Fwupd-1.7.7 "Fwupd 1.7.7 Released For Firmware Updating More Logitech Devices On Linux - Phoronix")

Lutris' Flatpak version is still being improved upon as the next step in enhancing the Steam Deck support for this game manager. 
  * [Mathieu Comandon on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MComandon/status/1507827306072457218 "Mathieu Comandon on Twitter") — We gotta stop this culture of "only install Flatpaks / using root is dangerous" before it extends beyond the Steam Deck. Last thing I want is for desktop Linux to become like Android or ChromeOS.
