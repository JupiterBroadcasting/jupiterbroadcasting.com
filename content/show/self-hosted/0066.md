  * [10 years of Raspberry Pi - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiwm5TMHIy8 "10 years of Raspberry Pi - YouTube") — Almost exactly ten years ago today, thousands of you set your alarms, and woke on leap-day morning to discover that we’d started selling Raspberry Pi computers. By the time our all-volunteer team gathered in the pub that evening for celebratory drinks, our licensees Farnell and RS Components had taken over 100,000 orders (despite struggling to keep their websites online under the load); we had (briefly) out-trended Lady Gaga; and Raspberry Pi was on the road to becoming a little larger than we’d planned.
  * [Too expensive to run in the UK now?!](https://old.reddit.com/r/PleX/comments/t8u3x7/too_expensive_to_run_in_the_uk_now/ "Too expensive to run in the UK now?!") — My server uses 136 watts, and will costs £1.80 a day to run from June when the price increases kick in costing £54 a month. I'm starting to think maybe it's not worth it anymore having it run all the time! Is anyone else re-thinking their home servers given the current cost situation?
  * [Check if the energy price cap affects you](https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/information-consumers/energy-advice-households/check-if-energy-price-cap-affects-you "Check if the energy price cap affects you")
  * [The future of computers is only $4 away, with Raspberry Pi CEO Eben Upton](https://www.theverge.com/22966155/raspberry-pi-ceo-interview-eben-upton-computer-chip-shortage-diy "The future of computers is only $4 away, with Raspberry Pi CEO Eben Upton") — TodayToday I’m talking to Eben Upton, the CEO of Raspberry Pi, a fascinating company that makes beloved tiny hackable computers that are extremely inexpensive: the cheapest Raspberry Pi is just $4, the most popular model is about $35, and the most expensive model that comes with a keyboard is $70. They run Linux, and you can do just about anything with them: people build robots, they learn to code, they run media servers.

  * [ConBee II Overview](https://phoscon.de/en/conbee2 "ConBee II Overview") — Unites Zigbee devices of many vendors
  * [OSMC](https://osmc.tv/ "OSMC") — OSMC is a free and open source media center built for the people, by the people. 
  * [Argon EON: 4-Bay Network Storage powered by Raspberry Pi 4 by Argon Forty — Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/argonforty/argon-eon-4-bay-network-storage-powered-by-raspberry-pi-4 "Argon EON: 4-Bay Network Storage powered by Raspberry Pi 4 by Argon Forty — Kickstarter") — A Network Attached Storage (NAS) for people who love to tinker around with cool stuff and the makers at heart.

  * [Which devices will work with Matter?](https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/dozens-of-brands-pledge-support-for-matter-at-ces-2022/ "Which devices will work with Matter?") — Matter is designed to bring the smart home together, and big brands including Google, Amazon and Apple are making plans for compatibility.
