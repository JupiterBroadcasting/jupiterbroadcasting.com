  * [Virtual x86](https://copy.sh/v86/ "Virtual x86") ‚Äî v86 emulates an x86-compatible CPU and hardware. Machine code is translated to WebAssembly modules at runtime in order to achieve decent performance.
  * [The Linux desktop is boring again](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-its-a-good-thing-that-the-linux-desktop-is-boring-again/ "The Linux desktop is boring again") ‚Äî Where I was once a constant "fiddler" with my desktop, I now want the interface to work how I want it to work, but still look the way I want it to look. I'm more of a minimalist now, so GNOME suits my needs on both levels quite well. However, I find myself rather bored with the Linux desktop.
  * [What to look for in Fedora Workstation 34 ‚Äî Christian F.K. Schaller](https://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2021/03/15/what-to-look-for-fedora-workstation-34/ "What to look for in Fedora Workstation 34 ‚Äî Christian F.K. Schaller") ‚Äî The big ticket item we have wanted to close off on was Wayland, because while Wayland has been production ready for most of us for a while, there was still some cases it didn‚Äôt cover as well as X.org.
  * [Christian Schaller on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cfkschaller "Christian Schaller on Twitter") ‚Äî 2020 was a year where we focused a lot on polishing what we had and getting things past the finish line and Fedora Workstation 34 is going to be the culmination of that effort in many ways.
  * [GNOME 40 Introducing Headless Native Backend, Virtual Monitors](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=GNOME-40-Headless-Virtual "GNOME 40 Introducing Headless Native Backend, Virtual Monitors") ‚Äî As part of this headless native back-end is also the ability to create virtual monitors via command-line options for debugging and other purposes. This also allows creating virtual monitor PipeWire streams.
  * [What‚Äôs New in Libhandy 1.2](https://aplazas.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/blog/blog/2021/03/12/libhandy-1-2.html "What‚Äôs New in Libhandy 1.2")
  * [Reinventing tabs](https://blogs.gnome.org/alexm/2021/03/13/reinventing-tabs/ "Reinventing tabs") ‚Äî In GNOME 40, Epiphany will feature a new tab bar. This isn‚Äôt just a restyling of the old one, but a ground-up rewrite.
  * [My geek stuff blog: Maps and GNOME 40](http://ml4711.blogspot.com/2021/03/maps-and-gnome-40.html "My geek stuff blog: Maps and GNOME 40")

  * [Pick: ebpfsnitch](https://github.com/harporoeder/ebpfsnitch "Pick: ebpfsnitch") ‚Äî eBPFSnitch is a Linux Application Level Firewall based on eBPF and NFQUEUE. It is inspired by OpenSnitch and Douane but utilizing modern kernel abstractions - without a kernel module.
