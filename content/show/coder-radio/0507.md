  * [Ford Applies for Patent to Let Cars Repossess Themselves](https://www.extremetech.com/internet/343506-ford-applies-for-patent-to-let-cars-repossess-themselves "Ford Applies for Patent to Let Cars Repossess Themselves") — Ford filed the patent application with the US Trademark and Patent Office in the summer of 2021, but the document was only published last week as part of the review process. Titled “Systems and Methods to Repossess a Vehicle,” the application summarizes a system that would autonomize the repossession process. First, a computer (likely associated with a financing agency) would send a message to the purchaser or lessee of a vehicle informing them of their delinquency. This message would contain a request to confirm receipt.
