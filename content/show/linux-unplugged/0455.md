  * [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Dark Style Changes](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-22-04-lts-dark-style-changes/27206 "Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Dark Style Changes") — Now in GNOME 42, it is officially supported, expanding on a concept from elementary OS 6 7. A toggle switch in the new Appearance panel in the core Settings app enables and disables the feature. A lot of work was done in GNOME apps to fix visual dark style bugs. A new transition effect was added (also inspired by elementary) to more elegantly crossfade when the style is switched.
