## Episode links

  * [Feedback from Steve: Employment vs self-employment](https://slexy.org/view/s27SXkiiQ7 "Feedback from Steve: Employment vs self-employment") — Just a comment regarding an episode a few weeks back regarding being an employee or working for oneself. 
  * [Emma on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SocialHappiness/status/1095007691326447616 "Emma on Twitter") — Keep @dominucco away and make sure all beverages are in a separate room!
  * [Why Freelancing Creates Anxiety About Money](https://www.thecut.com/2019/02/why-freelancing-creates-anxiety-about-money.html "Why Freelancing Creates Anxiety About Money") — But once I started freelancing, things changed. I became hyperconscious of how much money I could (or should) charge for my time, and this made me unhappy and mean when my nonworking hours didn’t measure up to the same value. It was akin to the rage of watching cab fare tick up while you’re sitting in traffic, minutes and dollars dribbling away before your eyes.
  * [What Hooks Mean for Vue](https://css-tricks.com/what-hooks-mean-for-vue/ "What Hooks Mean for Vue") — You may read through this and wonder what Hooks have to offer in Vue. It seems like a problem that doesn’t need solving. After all, Vue doesn’t predominantly use classes. Vue offers stateless functional components (should you need them), but why would we need to carry state in a functional component?
  * [Hooks at a Glance – React](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html "Hooks at a Glance – React") — Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes.
  * [Making Sense of React Hooks – Dan Abramov](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889 "Making Sense of React Hooks – Dan Abramov") — Unlike patterns like render props or higher-order components, Hooks don’t introduce unnecessary nesting into your component tree. They also don’t suffer from the drawbacks of mixins.
  * [Create Your Own AI Family Portraits](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=NVIDIA-StyleGAN-Open-Source "Create Your Own AI Family Portraits") — This week NVIDIA's research engineers open-sourced StyleGAN, the project they've been working in for months as a Style-based generator architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks. 
  * [A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.04948.pdf "A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks")
  * [StyleGAN GitHub](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan "StyleGAN GitHub") — This repository contains the official TensorFlow implementation
  * [Python Developers Survey 2018 Results](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/python-developers-survey-2018/ "Python Developers Survey 2018 Results") — In the fall of 2018, the Python Software Foundation together with JetBrains conducted the official annual Python Developers Survey for the second time.
  * [miniC](https://github.com/vasyop/miniC-hosting/blob/master/README.md "miniC") — What is it? A simple stack-based virtual machine that runs C (missing features below) in the browser and the beginning of an interactive tutorial that covers C, how the VM works, and how the language is compiled.
  * [MiniC Online Demo](https://vasyop.github.io/miniC-hosting/ "MiniC Online Demo")
  * [Make all videos fun to watch](https://labs.earthpeople.se/2019/02/make-all-videos-fun-to-watch/ "Make all videos fun to watch") — Our project Laff track is a plugin to Chrome, which adds this craziness to all Youtube videos. It simply detects when people are not talking, and adds in a bit of laughter.
