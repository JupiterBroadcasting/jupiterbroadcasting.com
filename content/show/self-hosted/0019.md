  * [Home Assistant on Twitter](https://twitter.com/home_assistant/status/1259217072795639814 "Home Assistant on Twitter") — "We're deprecating the Home Assistant Supervised installation on Generic Linux. Alternatives are to run Home Assistant Core in a Docker container or run our OS in a VM."
  * [[On hold] Deprecating Home Assistant Supervised on generic Linux ](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2020/05/09/deprecating-home-assistant-supervised-on-generic-linux/ "\[On hold\] Deprecating Home Assistant Supervised on generic Linux ") — We’re going to put the deprecation plan on hold for now. Anyone running this installation method today can continue running this. We will offer more clear information in the future.
  * [traefik host mode example](https://github.com/IronicBadger/infra/blob/master/dev/traefik/docker-compose.yaml "traefik host mode example")
  * [HomelabOS](https://homelabos.com/ "HomelabOS") — Your offline-first privacy-centric personal data center.
  * [HomelabOS - Syncing Settings via Git](https://homelabos.com/docs/setup/installation/#syncing-settings-via-git "HomelabOS - Syncing Settings via Git") — HomelabOS will automatically keep the settings/ folder in sync with a git repo if it has one. So you can create a private repo on your Gitea instance for example, then clone that repo over the settings folder. Now any changes you make to settings/ files will be commited and pushed to that git repo whenever you run make, make update or make config.
  * [Introduction - HomelabOS](https://homelabos.com/docs/setup/introduction/ "Introduction - HomelabOS") — Ansible templates out the HomelabOS config file using Jinja2 templating, which is then used to deploy HomelabOS itself.
  * [sanoid for ZFS Snapshots](https://github.com/jimsalterjrs/sanoid "sanoid for ZFS Snapshots") — Policy-driven snapshot management and replication tools. Using ZFS for underlying next-gen storage.
