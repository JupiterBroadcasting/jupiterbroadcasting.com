  * [Framework Laptop review (hands on) — the anti-MacBook is here](https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/framework-laptop-review-hands-on-the-anti-macbook-is-here "Framework Laptop review \(hands on\) — the anti-MacBook is here") — This is a big deal for DIY computing enthusiasts, and it's a powerful sales pitch in a market where leading manufacturers like Apple proudly release products designed to be difficult (if not impossible) for customers to crack open and tinker with themselves.
  * [Framework Laptop pre-orders are now open](https://frame.work/ "Framework Laptop pre-orders are now open") — Starting at $999, with a fully refundable $100 deposit 
  * [Google I/O 2021 preview](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/google-i-o-2021-preview-google-resurrects-wear-os-and-android-tablets/ "Google I/O 2021 preview") — Google I/O starts Tuesday, May 18 at 1 pm EDT, when Google/Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai will take the stage and presumably show off what Google has been working on all year. 
  * [How M1 Macs feel faster than Intel models: it’s about QoS](https://eclecticlight.co/2021/05/17/how-m1-macs-feel-faster-than-intel-models-its-about-qos/ "How M1 Macs feel faster than Intel models: it’s about QoS") — The pattern of use of cores is that almost all the activities of macOS are run on the Efficiency cores, with only the occasional blip on the Performance cores. Running apps and performing other user tasks is the other way around, with the brunt borne on the Performance rather than Efficiency cores. This is because those user tasks are more likely to run with QoS of at least 17, and in many cases 25 and 33.
  * [Lima: Linux-on-Mac: "macOS subsystem for Linux"](https://github.com/AkihiroSuda/lima/tree/master "Lima: Linux-on-Mac: "macOS subsystem for Linux"") — Lima can be considered as a some sort of unofficial "macOS subsystem for Linux", or "containerd for Mac".
