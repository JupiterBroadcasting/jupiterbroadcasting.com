  * [The disproportionate influence of early tech decisions](https://brandur.org/fragments/early-tech-decisions "The disproportionate influence of early tech decisions") — A common theme is that all of these were known to be very imperfect implementations even when they were originally added, but they were added anyway in the name of velocity, with an implicit assumption baked in that they’d be shored up and improved later when there were more resources and slack time to do so

To confirm when I say 6pm GMT I mean 6pm as you look your watch - time savings and all that be damned - you know what I mean when I say 6pm GMT :)
