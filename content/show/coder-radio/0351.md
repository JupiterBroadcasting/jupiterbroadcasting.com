  * [dotnet-script](https://github.com/filipw/dotnet-script "dotnet-script") — Run C# scripts from the .NET CLI.
  * [Feedback from Tom](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoderRadio/comments/b655ct/rusty_stadia_coder_radio_350/ejp3tq4/ "Feedback from Tom") — I haven't tried Rust yet, but it seems to have a lof of momentum. Maybe there are issues with it, but I'm not going to take advice from someone who "really doesn't care" that Rust produces safer and more secure code.
  * [Mike's fork of stl-thumb](https://github.com/dominickm/stl-thumb "Mike's fork of stl-thumb") — Stl-thumb is a fast lightweight thumbnail generator for STL files.
  * [Why I miss Rails](https://chanind.github.io/rails/2019/03/28/why-i-miss-rails.html "Why I miss Rails") — In the transition to the modern web stack we’ve unsolved some of what tools like Rails made easy 10 years ago. I don’t think it needs to be that way.

Phoenix leverages the Erlang VM ability to handle millions of connections alongside Elixir's beautiful syntax and productive tooling for building fault-tolerant systems.

No Need to Write JavaScript.](https://dockyard.com/blog/2018/12/12/phoenix-liveview-interactive-real-time-apps-no-need-to-write-javascript "Phoenix LiveView: Interactive, Real-Time Apps. No Need to Write JavaScript.") — LiveView powered applications are stateful on the server with bidrectional communication via WebSockets, offering a vastly simplified programming model compared to JavaScript alternatives.
