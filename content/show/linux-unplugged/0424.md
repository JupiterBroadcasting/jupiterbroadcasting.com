  * [Building an Alternative Ecosystem | Joshua Strobl](https://joshuastrobl.com/2021/09/14/building-an-alternative-ecosystem/ "Building an Alternative Ecosystem | Joshua Strobl") — While we have been consistent in this vision, though certainly not without flaws in its execution, we have seen a significant shift from GNOME’s development efforts and vision being focused from their desktop experience, to a heavier focus on mobile-to-desktop application scalability and a more touch-oriented, almost iPadOS like user experience that does not (in our opinion) provide the most optimized experience for laptop and desktop users.
  * [The Truth they are not telling you about “Themes” – Rust in Peace](https://blogs.gnome.org/alatiera/2021/09/18/the-truth-they-are-not-telling-you-about-themes/ "The Truth they are not telling you about “Themes” – Rust in Peace") — There seems to be some confusion when it comes to libadwaita’s stylesheet and coloring APIs.
  * [Red Hat’s Upstream Contributions Are Making For A Great Fedora Workstation 35 - Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Fedora-35-Great-Features-Coming "Red Hat’s Upstream Contributions Are Making For A Great Fedora Workstation 35 - Phoronix") — Fedora Workstation 35 will hopefully be out at the end of October (currently the beta is running behind schedule) and when it does ship it's once again at the bleeding-edge of Linux features.
  * [GNOME 41 has new multitasking settings!](https://www.reddit.com/r/gnome/comments/p4x4lg/gnome_41_has_new_multitasking_settings/ "GNOME 41 has new multitasking settings!")
  * [SeaGL is coming up soon, and is virtual this year](https://seagl.org/ "SeaGL is coming up soon, and is virtual this year") — November 5th & 6th, 2021
  * [This Week in Matrix](https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix "This Week in Matrix")
  * [Spaces: The next frontier](https://element.io/blog/spaces-the-next-frontier/ "Spaces: The next frontier") — Using Spaces and Subspaces to build hierarchies effectively turns Matrix into a global decentralised filesystem for conversations and other real-time data!
  * [toger5/TheBoard](https://github.com/toger5/TheBoard "toger5/TheBoard") — A collaborative Whiteboard powered by the [matrix] protocol and infrastucture.
  * [Matrix Live](https://matrix.org/matrixlive/ "Matrix Live")
  * [Compressing Synapse database | Levans’ workshop](https://levans.fr/shrink-synapse-database.html "Compressing Synapse database | Levans’ workshop") — Anyone running a federating instance of the Matrix homeserver Synapse will likely have seen this: synapse is database-hungry. It tends to take a lot of space. In this post, I'm documenting how I shrunk my homeserver database from 100GB to a little under 8GB, during a long maintenance cleanup.
  * [Pick: Wayfire](https://wayfire.org/ "Pick: Wayfire") — Wayfire is a wayland compositor based on wlroots. It aims to create a customizable, extendable and lightweight environment without sacrificing its appearance.
