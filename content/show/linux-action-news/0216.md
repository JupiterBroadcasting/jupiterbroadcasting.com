### Episode Links

  * [Linux has a serious security problem that once again enables DNS cache poisoning](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/dan-kaminskys-dns-cache-poisoning-attack-is-back-from-the-dead-again/ "Linux has a serious security problem that once again enables DNS cache poisoning") — We can actually guess the ephemeral port in the embedded UDP packet and package it in an ICMP probe to a DNS resolver. If the guessed port is correct, it causes some global resource in the Linux kernel to change, which can be indirectly observed. This is how the attacker can infer which ephemeral port is used.
  * [Ubuntu Maker Canonical Planning To Vastly Improve Its Documentation](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Better-Ubuntu-Docs-2021 "Ubuntu Maker Canonical Planning To Vastly Improve Its Documentation") — This is a permanent, on-going commitment. It’s work that will never end. It has already started, and will become part of the fundamental Canonical discipline of making software.
  * [The future of documentation at Canonical](https://ubuntu.com//blog/the-future-of-documentation-at-canonical "The future of documentation at Canonical")
  * [APT 2.3.12 package manager released, will no longer let you break everything](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/apt-2312-package-manager-released-will-no-longer-let-you-break-everything/ "APT 2.3.12 package manager released, will no longer let you break everything") — After the issues that happened with Linus from Linus Tech Tips breaking Pop!_OS during the switch to Linux challenge, the APT package manager has been upgraded to prevent future issues happening.
  * [KDE Discover gets update to prevent you breaking your Linux system](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2021/11/kde-discover-prevents-breaking-your-linux-system/page=12/ "KDE Discover gets update to prevent you breaking your Linux system") — Another change to make things look a bit friendlier in Discover is if you have issues upgrading, it will instantly shove a load of technical details in your face. To normal consumers, that's clearly not going to do much to help and probably scare them away. Now, instead, it will provide a very clear and friendly message, with the option to get more details to report the issue.
  * [Add support for list issue - Jens Axboe](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-block/20211117033807.185715-1-axboe@kernel.dk/ "Add support for list issue - Jens Axboe") — With the support in 5.16-rc1 for allocating and completing batches of IO, the one missing piece is passing down a list of requests for issue. 
  * [Linux 5.17 To Continue With I/O Optimizations, 5~6% Improvement Pending For NVMe](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-5.17-Will-Continue-IO "Linux 5.17 To Continue With I/O Optimizations, 5~6% Improvement Pending For NVMe") — With the merge window for 5.16 closed, time to submit for review some of the performance optimizations that didn't make this release. Here's batched issue for blk-mq with an NVMe implementation included. 5-6% improvement.
  * [Linux 5.17 To Boast A Big TCP Performance Optimization](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-5.17-TCP-Optimization&utm_content=187840157&utm_medium=social&utm_source=linkedin&hss_channel=lcp-11041071 "Linux 5.17 To Boast A Big TCP Performance Optimization")
  * [Linux 5.17 To Bring DRM Privacy-Screen Support, Intel VESA PWM Backlight Handling](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-5.17-Privacy-Screen-Next "Linux 5.17 To Bring DRM Privacy-Screen Support, Intel VESA PWM Backlight Handling") — The Linux 5.16 merge window now past, an initial batch of changes from drm-misc-next has been sent in to DRM-Next for queuing until the Linux 5.17 cycle kicks off around the start of the new year.
  * [Ubuntu Touch OTA-20 Released for Linux Phones, Here’s What’s New](https://9to5linux.com/ubuntu-touch-ota-20-released-for-linux-phones-heres-whats-new "Ubuntu Touch OTA-20 Released for Linux Phones, Here’s What’s New") — The UBports Foundation released today the Ubuntu Touch OTA-20 software update for Ubuntu Phone devices with various improvements and more bug fixes.

The fixes range from a possible DFU crash to DLI download troubles and other device-specific corrections.
