In other words, support running unmodified Linux binaries!
  * [Roving With Perseverance - NASA Mars](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/participate/rover-tour/ "Roving With Perseverance - NASA Mars") — Displays including full-scale models of Perseverance and the Ingenuity Mars helicopter will be on exhibit in museums across the country
  * [The Museum of Flight – NASA’s Mars Exploration Program](https://mars.nasa.gov/events/237/ "The Museum of Flight – NASA’s Mars Exploration Program") — NASA’s Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter models will be on display, October 30, 2021 - April 3, 2022
  * [Remote desktop and screen casting in Wayland - GNOME Wiki!](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Mutter/RemoteDesktop "Remote desktop and screen casting in Wayland - GNOME Wiki!") — Remote desktop functionality is not implemented in mutter but in GNOME Remote Desktop. GNOME Remote Desktop currently supports "screen share", also known as "remote assistance" mode through VNC or RDP. VNC support is provided via LibVNCServer and RDP support is provided via FreeRDP.
  * [GNOME remote desktop RDP setup guide](https://gitlab.gnome.org/-/snippets/1778 "GNOME remote desktop RDP setup guide") — The RDP server in gnome-remote-desktop currently doesn't have the UI to setup yet. To be able to use the RDP server, the server certificate, private keyfile and credentials therefore need to be created manually.

  * [Worth the wait: Fedora Linux 35 is here!](https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-35/ "Worth the wait: Fedora Linux 35 is here!") — We switched the default audio system to PipeWire in Fedora Linux 34, and now we’re improving this by adding the new WirePlumber session manager. WirePlumber allows for more customization of the policy and rules for audio and video. It provides a richer development experience and adds bindings for most languages.
  * [WirePlumber 0.4.4 documentation](https://pipewire.pages.freedesktop.org/wireplumber/index.html "WirePlumber 0.4.4 documentation") — WirePlumber is a modular session / policy manager for PipeWire and a GObject-based high-level library that wraps PipeWire’s API, providing convenience for writing the daemon’s modules as well as external tools for managing PipeWire.
  * [Tom Wagner / Helvum](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/ryuukyu/helvum "Tom Wagner / Helvum") — Helvum is a GTK-based patchbay for pipewire, inspired by the JACK tool catia.
