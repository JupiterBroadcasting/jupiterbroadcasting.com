### Episode Links

  * [Virtual x86](https://copy.sh/v86/ "Virtual x86") — v86 emulates an x86-compatible CPU and hardware. Machine code is translated to WebAssembly modules at runtime in order to achieve decent performance.
  * [The Linux desktop is boring again](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-its-a-good-thing-that-the-linux-desktop-is-boring-again/ "The Linux desktop is boring again") — Where I was once a constant "fiddler" with my desktop, I now want the interface to work how I want it to work, but still look the way I want it to look. I'm more of a minimalist now, so GNOME suits my needs on both levels quite well. However, I find myself rather bored with the Linux desktop.
  * [What to look for in Fedora Workstation 34 — Christian F.K. Schaller](https://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2021/03/15/what-to-look-for-fedora-workstation-34/ "What to look for in Fedora Workstation 34 — Christian F.K. Schaller") — The big ticket item we have wanted to close off on was Wayland, because while Wayland has been production ready for most of us for a while, there was still some cases it didn’t cover as well as X.org.
  * [Christian Schaller on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cfkschaller "Christian Schaller on Twitter") — 2020 was a year where we focused a lot on polishing what we had and getting things past the finish line and Fedora Workstation 34 is going to be the culmination of that effort in many ways.
  * [GNOME 40 Introducing Headless Native Backend, Virtual Monitors](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=GNOME-40-Headless-Virtual "GNOME 40 Introducing Headless Native Backend, Virtual Monitors") — As part of this headless native back-end is also the ability to create virtual monitors via command-line options for debugging and other purposes. This also allows creating virtual monitor PipeWire streams.
  * [What’s New in Libhandy 1.2](https://aplazas.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/blog/blog/2021/03/12/libhandy-1-2.html "What’s New in Libhandy 1.2")
  * [Reinventing tabs](https://blogs.gnome.org/alexm/2021/03/13/reinventing-tabs/ "Reinventing tabs") — In GNOME 40, Epiphany will feature a new tab bar. This isn’t just a restyling of the old one, but a ground-up rewrite.
  * [My geek stuff blog: Maps and GNOME 40](http://ml4711.blogspot.com/2021/03/maps-and-gnome-40.html "My geek stuff blog: Maps and GNOME 40")
  * [GNOME 40 & your extension – GNOME Shell & Mutter](https://blogs.gnome.org/shell-dev/2021/03/12/gnome-40-your-extension/ "GNOME 40 & your extension – GNOME Shell & Mutter")
  * [OBS Studio on Wayland](https://discourse.flathub.org/t/obs-studio-on-flathub-beta/690 "OBS Studio on Wayland")
