  * [Plasma Mobile test ISOs](http://blog.bshah.in/2018/01/26/trying-out-plasma-mobile/ "Plasma Mobile test ISOs") — 44% poll participants wanting to test Plasma Mobile on their device, and/or as a virtual machine, or on real machine.
  * [Purism aims for convergence](https://puri.sm/posts/librem5-progress-report-2/ "Purism aims for convergence") — Upon successful completion of our funding campaign, we started to look for a Designer to take care of the user experience for the Librem 5, and a web developer to help us improve the look & feel (and more technical parts) of our website in general. Today, I’m glad to finally welcome them publicly!
  * [Mycroft Mark 2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aiforeveryone/mycroft-mark-ii-the-open-voice-assistant "Mycroft Mark 2") — What sets Mark II apart? It’s open source. This means your personal data stays private, you can customize your experience, and Mycroft is a neutral player in the voice game, allowing you to be confident in your personal preference of apps and skills. 
  * [Ubuntu 18.04 to revert to Xorg by default](https://insights.ubuntu.com/2018/01/26/bionic-beaver-18-04-lts-to-use-xorg-by-default/ "Ubuntu 18.04 to revert to Xorg by default") — We have decided that we will ship Xorg by default, and that Wayland will be an optional session available from the login screen. 
  * [Torvalds unhappy with Intel's response to Spectre](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/22/intel_spectre_fix_linux/ "Torvalds unhappy with Intel's response to Spectre") — Instead of treating Spectre as a bug, the chip maker is offering Spectre protection as a feature.
  * [Are the BSDs dying?](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3250653/open-source-tools/is-the-bsd-os-dying-some-security-researchers-think-so.html "Are the BSDs dying?") — Too few eyeballs on code is a security issue as vulnerabilities go unreported and unpatched. Can FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD survive?
