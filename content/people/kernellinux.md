bio: In 2009 Noah gave up on traditional IT models and started Altispeed Technologies.
  Since 2009 Altispeed has leveraged open source technologies to provide creative
  cost saving solutions without sacrificing quality. As a former host of the Linux
  Action Show Noah couldn't let his passion wind down with the show so teamed up with
  Jupiter Broadcasting to bring you Ask Noah!
