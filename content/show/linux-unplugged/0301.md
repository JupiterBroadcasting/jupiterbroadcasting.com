  * [Scientists Develop Software That Simulates Sound Of Stars](https://www.techtimes.com/articles/242474/20190428/scientists-develop-software-that-simulates-sound-of-stars.htm "Scientists Develop Software That Simulates Sound Of Stars") — A team of astronomers from University of Wisconsin-Madison successfully developed a software called GYRE that can simulate the complex vibrations that stars produce.
  * [GitHub Package Registry: Your packages, at home with their code](https://github.com/features/package-registry "GitHub Package Registry: Your packages, at home with their code") — Discover and publish public and private packages in one place. Then seamlessly use and reuse any package as a dependency in a project by downloading it straight from GitHub. 
  * [About GitHub Package Registry](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-github-package-registry "About GitHub Package Registry") — GitHub Package Registry is a software package hosting service, similar to npmjs.org, rubygems.org, or hub.docker.com, that allows you to host your packages and code in one place.
  * [Package hello-world-npm](https://github.com/Codertocat/hello-world-npm/packages/10696?version=1.0.1 "Package hello-world-npm") — This is a simple npm package that demonstrates the GitHub Package Registry. 
  * [Lenovo adds AMD Ryzen Pro-powered laptops to its ThinkPad family](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/lenovo-adds-amd-ryzen-pro-powered-laptops-to-its-thinkpad-family/ "Lenovo adds AMD Ryzen Pro-powered laptops to its ThinkPad family") — The biggest differences between these laptops and Intel-powered ThinkPads are performance and ports. According to Lenovo, the second-gen AMD Ryzen 7 Pro processors combined with integrated Vega graphics should provide an 18-percent improvement in performance over previous generations
  * [Clear Linux Further Enhances Its Desktop Installer, Launches Help Forums](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Clear-Linux-Desktop-Installer-2 "Clear Linux Further Enhances Its Desktop Installer, Launches Help Forums") — This week I was pleased to find they have further improved the graphical interface for making their desktop Linux installation on-par with other Linux installers. If you recall, it was only towards the end of last year that they rolled out a new desktop installer and now with their latest design improvements, their latest installer looks much better off than their previous version. 
  * [It's Time To Pay Attention To Intel's Clear Linux OS Project](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2019/05/13/its-time-to-pay-attention-to-intels-clear-linux-os-project/#5004b8885c49 "It's Time To Pay Attention To Intel's Clear Linux OS Project") — This is neither a review nor an endorsement of Clear Linux at this stage, but it is an open invitation to be curious about it. To explore it. Maybe to even actively contribute to it. Especially as we edge closer to Intel's assault on the dedicated GPU market.
  * [Install Clear Linux* OS from the live desktop](https://clearlinux.org/documentation/clear-linux/get-started/bare-metal-install-desktop "Install Clear Linux* OS from the live desktop") — The live desktop allows you to boot Clear Linux* OS in a GNOME desktop without modifying the host system, offering the chance to explore developing on Clear Linux OS. Better yet, launch the Clear Linux OS installer to install on your target system.
  * [Clear Linux* OS - An Introduction and Beyond](https://clearlinux.org/news-blogs/clear-linux-os-introduction-and-beyond "Clear Linux* OS - An Introduction and Beyond") — We invite you to join us for the first in a series of Intel Clear Linux OS MeetUps. The aim of this initial MeetUp is to introduce you to the Clear Linux* project and help you learn how to better use the Clear Linux OS in your everyday job. Light refreshments and dinner provided.
  * [Ulauncher is migrating to Python 3. Changes to Extension API and more](https://mailchi.mp/fbb4b54c426a/ulauncher-is-migrating-to-python-3-changes-to-extension-api-and-more "Ulauncher is migrating to Python 3. Changes to Extension API and more") — It's been a while since the last significant update in Ulauncher. One of the reasons was the migration from Python 2 to 3. For a regular user it may not mean a lot, but Python 2 end of life is coming very soon so that had to be done.
  * [2019 Is the Year of Linux on the Desktop](https://www.howtogeek.com/414036/2019-is-the-year-of-linux-on-the-desktop/ "2019 Is the Year of Linux on the Desktop") — Traditional Linux distributions may not be taking over the world, but Linux is becoming even more pervasive than ever.
  * [The Friday Stream Episode 3: Fluffle of Fools](https://fridaystream.com/3 "The Friday Stream Episode 3: Fluffle of Fools") — Back from Boston and we have a few stories to share, the best 39 seconds from Red Hat Summit, and the protest we found our selves in the middle of. 
  * [Texas Linux Fest 2019](https://2019.texaslinuxfest.org/ "Texas Linux Fest 2019") — Texas Linux Fest is an annual Linux and open source software event for Texas and the surrounding region. We are excited to bring you two days of general sessions and vendor sessions this year along with two full days of expo floor! Texas Linux Fest is for the business and home Linux user, and for the experienced developer and newcomer alike.
  * [Can I get a RHEL yeah? Version 8 arrives at last as IBM given go-ahead to wolf down Red Hat • The Register](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/05/07/red_hat_enterprise_linux_8/ "Can I get a RHEL yeah? Version 8 arrives at last as IBM given go-ahead to wolf down Red Hat • The Register") — Distributed with the Linux 4.18 kernel, the OS supports AMD and Intel 64-bit architectures, as one would expect, as well as 64-bit Arm, IBM Power Systems and IBM Z.
  * [Introducing the Red Hat Universal Base Image](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image "Introducing the Red Hat Universal Base Image") — With the release of the Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI), you can now take advantage of the greater reliability, security, and performance of official Red Hat container images where OCI-compliant Linux containers run - whether you’re a customer or not. 
  * [Azure Red Hat OpenShift, a Kubernetes service jointly managed by Microsoft and Red Hat, is now available](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/azure-red-hat-openshift-kubernetes-service-jointly-managed-microsoft-red-hat-now-available/ "Azure Red Hat OpenShift, a Kubernetes service jointly managed by Microsoft and Red Hat, is now available") — The two companies announced Azure Red Hat OpenShift at last year’s Red Hat Summit. OpenShift is available on other public clouds, but Microsoft and Red Hat will jointly manage and support this service on Azure and customers will be able to pay for it through a single unified bill from Azure under a revenue-sharing agreement.
  * [Red Hat Summit 2019](https://linuxunplugged.com/articles/red-hat-summit-2019 "Red Hat Summit 2019") — Are cloud and culture alive and well at Red Hat? If I've taken away anything from this year's Red Hat Summit (my first), it's the two simple words "cloud and culture." Two words echoed several times this past week which to me is obviously by design. Red Hat and IBM want us to know they are ready for the cloud, hybrid-cloud, other person's Linux box, and its culture is still alive and well despite grumbling in the community about the IBM acquisition.
  * [Red Hat Summit 2019 Recap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxGTGWwLTio&feature=youtu.be "Red Hat Summit 2019 Recap")
  * [Command Line Threat Hunting](https://www.meetup.com/jupiterbroadcasting/events/260707829/ "Command Line Threat Hunting") — That viruses and malware are Windows problems is a misnomer that is often propagated through the Linux community and it's an easy one to believe until you start noticing strange behaviour on your system. What do you do next? Join Ell Marquez (Jupiter Broadcasting/Linux Academy) and Tony Lambert (redcanary.com) in discussing a common sense approach to threat detection using only command line tools.
