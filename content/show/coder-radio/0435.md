  * [Apple is appealing the Epic Games ruling it originally called a ‘resounding victory’](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/8/22717271/apple-appeals-epic-games-ruling-anti-steering "Apple is appealing the Epic Games ruling it originally called a ‘resounding victory’") — Apple has filed for an appeal of the ruling in its major trial against Epic. While Apple largely won that case (the company went so far as to call the ruling a “resounding victory”) with Judge Gonzalez Rogers ruling in favor of Apple in nine of the ten claims Epic brought against the company, it did lose in one important way: the judge found that Apple violated California’s anti-steering rules, and demanded that Apple let developers link to outside payment systems. That policy would have taken over in December, but it may be pushed out beyond that — and it seems that’s the point.
