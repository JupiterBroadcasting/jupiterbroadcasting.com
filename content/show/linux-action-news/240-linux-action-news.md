* [Why is the open source driver release from NVidia so important for Linux? | Christian F.K. Schaller](https://blogs.gnome.org/uraeus/2022/05/11/why-is-the-open-source-driver-release-from-nvidia-so-important-for-linux/) — Today NVidia announced that they are releasing an open source kernel driver for their GPUs, so I want to share with you some background information and how this will impact Linux graphics and compute going forward.
* [NVIDIA Releases Open-Source GPU Kernel Modules](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-releases-open-source-gpu-kernel-modules/) — This release is a significant step toward improving the experience of using NVIDIA GPUs in Linux, for tighter integration with the OS and for developers to debug, integrate, and contribute back.
* [NVIDIA Transitioning To Official, Open-Source Linux GPU Kernel Driver](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=nvidia-open-kernel&num=1) — NVIDIA's open kernel modules is already considered "production ready, opt-in" for data center GPUs. For GeForce and workstation GPUs, the open kernel module code is considered "alpha quality" but will be ramped up moving forward with future releases.
