  * [The 737Max and Why Software Engineers Might Want to Pay Attention](https://medium.com/@jpaulreed/the-737max-and-why-software-engineers-should-pay-attention-a041290994bd "The 737Max and Why Software Engineers Might Want to Pay Attention") — What is different here is: the MCAS commands the trim in this condition without notifying the pilots AND to override the input, the pilots must deactivate the system via a switch on a console, NOT by retrimming the aircraft via the yoke, which is a more common way to manage the airplane’s trim.
  * [How a 50-year-old design came back to haunt Boeing with its troubled 737 Max jet - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-fi-boeing-max-design-20190315-story.html "How a 50-year-old design came back to haunt Boeing with its troubled 737 Max jet - Los Angeles Times") — The crisis comes after 50 years of remarkable success in making the 737 a profitable workhorse. Today, the aerospace giant has a massive backlog of more than 4,700 orders for the jetliner and its sales account for nearly a third of Boeing’s profit. But the decision to continue modernizing the jet, rather than starting at some point with a clean design, resulted in engineering challenges that created unforeseen risks.
