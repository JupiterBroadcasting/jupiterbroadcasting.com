#### Feedback

  * Emmet has made his own solution and [put it on Github](https://github.com/the-kid89/BNR/index.html) — and David recommends Uranos for him.
  * A number of you still love Codeacademy.com
  * Rellon is moving from Windows to Linux development and has fallen in love with Ruby (good choice). He would like some Ruby resources.
  * Adam says he’s loves the show (Awesome BTW!) but is having something of a problem wrapping his head around the arcane world of software licences. GPL? BSD? MIT? Apache? What does it all mean?
  * Pablo suggests we take a look at test driven development and unit testing one day — not a bad idea.
  * Fernando asks how I stay focussed enough on side commercial projects to actually complete them; I wonder if he likes tomatoes?
  * Colin says, “I see your email written in C and raise you a message in Haskell”. Yes, he wrote the email in Haskell.

#### PSA on Manners and the Real World

  * [Nixie has a problem: you.](https://youtu.be/CjB9z5vyv0I&feature=plcp)
  * And back to your regularly scheduled programming.

#### First Rule About Source Control: USE IT!!!

  * Everything in Source control no exceptions!
  * Centralised vs distributed?
  * Gui or command line?
  * Commit message formatting?

#### I Regret to Inform You that the Compiler is Almost Always Right

  * Don’t start with assumption that there is a bug in the vendor’s compiler / framework…
  * Having trouble? Consider writing test…
  * Test before you push, please….

#### Forget About Being Perfect, Be Good Enough and Get the Job Done

  * Don’t waste a week writing a “perfect” algorithm when a less perfect one will meet your needs and take significantly less time.
  * To that point it is almost always a good idea to use accepted solutions / algorithms for most problems you will encounter, rather than rolling your own.
