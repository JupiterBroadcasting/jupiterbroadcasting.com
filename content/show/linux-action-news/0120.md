### Episode Links

  * [Today, 28 years ago Linus Torvalds announced Linux on comp.os.minix.](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.os.minix/dlNtH7RRrGA/SwRavCzVE7gJ "Today, 28 years ago Linus Torvalds announced Linux on comp.os.minix.") — I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. 
  * [System76 announce new firmware updater](https://blog.system76.com/post/187072707563/the-new-firmware-manager-updating-firmware-across "System76 announce new firmware updater") — We’ve been working on the Firmware Manager project, which we will be shipping to all Pop!_OS users, and System76 hardware customers on other Debian-based distributions. It supports checking and updating firmware from LVFS and system76-firmware services, is Wayland-compatible, and provides both a GTK application and library.
  * [The Next Step in the OpenPOWER Foundation Journey](https://openpowerfoundation.org/the-next-step-in-the-openpower-foundation-journey/ "The Next Step in the OpenPOWER Foundation Journey") — The OpenPOWER Foundation will now join projects and organizations like OpenBMC, CHIPS Alliance, OpenHPC and so many others within the Linux Foundation. 
  * [IBM is moving OpenPower Foundation to The Linux Foundation](https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/20/ibm-is-moving-openpower-foundation-to-the-linux-foundation/ "IBM is moving OpenPower Foundation to The Linux Foundation")
  * [Confidential Computing Consortium](https://confidentialcomputing.io/ "Confidential Computing Consortium") — Confidential computing focuses on securing data in use. Current approaches to securing data often address data at rest (storage) and in transit (network)but encrypting data in use is possibly the most challenging step to providing a fully encrypted lifecycle for sensitive data.
  * [Confidential Computing Consortium Takes Shape](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/ossummit-confidential-computing/ "Confidential Computing Consortium Takes Shape")
  * [The year-long rash of supply chain attacks against open source is getting worse](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/08/the-year-long-rash-of-supply-chain-attacks-against-open-source-is-getting-worse/ "The year-long rash of supply chain attacks against open source is getting worse") — Backdoors snuck into 12 OSS packages were downloaded hundreds of thousands of times.
  * [Android to drop dessert names](https://blog.google/products/android/evolving-android-brand/ "Android to drop dessert names") — So, this next release of Android will simply use the version number and be called Android 10. We think this change helps make release names simpler and more intuitive for our global community. And while there were many tempting “Q” desserts out there, we think that at version 10 and 2.5 billion active devices, it was time to make this change.
