  * [Your preferred Linux "server" OS?](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/cpiz8s/your_preferred_linux_server_os/ "Your preferred Linux "server" OS?") — I currently host a bunch of services inside of Docker containers. Had been using Ubuntu Server, but I felt like the OS is kind of bloated and I wanted to try some new things so I switched to Alpine. Alpine is a bit too minimalistic for my tastes and I've run into some compatibility issues with it (even when using it just as a Docker host). At this point I'm planning on staying with a Linux OS and with Docker as the way I run my actual services, just not sure of what I want to actually use next.
  * [Wireless Security Camera System - EufyCam E Review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7eH5d9N-XU "Wireless Security Camera System - EufyCam E Review") — What's the best wireless security camera system? Here's my EufyCam E review, which covers my main criteria for a good camera system: battery-operated, easy to setup, good image quality, no subscription fees, local storage, and integrations with my smart home.
