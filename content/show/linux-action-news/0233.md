At the very least, such research and related activities should follow standard research ethics rules.

This is only the beginning, and things will move even more quickly going forward!
  * [Hector Martin on Twitter](https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1505992184079986688 "Hector Martin on Twitter") — We've been getting a steady trickle of users with the installation failing because the APFS resizer does a fsck and finds corruption. This confirms my personal experience that Apple's APFS code is just buggy... it seems a lot of people have latent filesystem corruption :(
