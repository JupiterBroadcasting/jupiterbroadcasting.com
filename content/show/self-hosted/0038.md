### Episode Links

  * [VZW TTL Trick Alex Found on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/8p69ez/bypassing_verizons_unlimited_plans/ "VZW TTL Trick Alex Found on Reddit") — By default, Android and iOS (probably) have IP TTL's of 64. The ISPs can use this knowledge to decide whether or not a packet originated from the Android device or if it was only routed through the Android device. For example, Linux distributions typically have a default TTL of 64. 
  * [FileRun - File Manager](http://www.filerun.com/ "FileRun - File Manager") — Just like you do with an FTP server, point FileRun to where you keep the files on your server and you will get instant web access to them.
  * [termpad](https://termpad.com/ "termpad") — Just an empty terminal, in your browser.
  * [Tinypin](https://github.com/slynn1324/tinypin "Tinypin") — A self-hosted, minimalistic image collection board. 
  * [OPNsense 21.1 Released ](https://opnsense.org/opnsense-21-1-marvelous-meerkat-released/ "OPNsense 21.1 Released ") — For those wondering, the WireGuard plugin has been available since 2019 and receives continuous improvements by its maintainer and various users alike. And that is unlikey to change in the future. 
  * [Setting up linuxserver/wireguard ](https://john.muchovej.com/thoughts/setting-up-liso-wireguard/ "Setting up linuxserver/wireguard ") — Putting your docker stack behind a VPN.
  * [linuxserver.io: WireGuard](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/wireguard "linuxserver.io: WireGuard") — Docker container to run WireGuard. 
  * [Passthrough Intel iGPU with GVT-g to a VM and use Quick Sync with Plex in docker on Proxmox](https://blog.ktz.me/passthrough-intel-igpu-with-gvt-g-to-a-vm-and-use-it-with-plex/ "Passthrough Intel iGPU with GVT-g to a VM and use Quick Sync with Plex in docker on Proxmox") — Passing through an entire GPU is very useful for specific tasks but isn't a very efficient use of resources. Wouldn't it be nice if we could slice up 1 GPU and use it with multiple VMs at once?
  * [Hassio-google-drive-backup](https://github.com/sabeechen/hassio-google-drive-backup "Hassio-google-drive-backup") — A complete and easy way to back up your Home Assistant snapshots to Google Drive.
  * [Duplicati](https://www.duplicati.com/ "Duplicati") — Backup files and folders with strong AES-256 encryption. Save space with incremental backups and data deduplication. Run backups on any machine through the web-based interface or via command line interface. Duplicati has a built-in scheduler and auto-updater.
