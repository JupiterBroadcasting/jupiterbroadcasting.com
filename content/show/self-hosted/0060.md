  * [Amazon Web Services crashed today : amazonecho](https://old.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/k0xqfk/amazon_web_services_crashed_today/ "Amazon Web Services crashed today : amazonecho") — I spent about an hour restarting routers, checking for updates, unplugging and plugging in devices, and scouring the web for answers and finally saw in the news that an AWS outage took out a huge chunk of the internet. Amazon hasn’t released a statement yet, that I know of, but I assume this is what’s affecting all of the devices, e.g., my smart plug stopped working and my echo dot and show only stream one song before quitting for no apparent reason.

The following Linuxserver containers have been confirmed not to be affected by CVE-2021-44228 or CVE-2021-45046 due to existing mitigations, upstream patches, or workarounds applied to the container images. 
  * [changedetection.io](https://github.com/dgtlmoon/changedetection.io "changedetection.io") — The best and simplest self-hosted open source website change detection monitoring and notification service.

It feels more like being together compared to a grid of webcam feeds. Especially for collaborative sessions this is a big win. 
  * [How to Approach a company about building an HA integration on their API?](https://paste.docs.lol/reader/PinningsAdvices "How to Approach a company about building an HA integration on their API?") — From the web UI I can see that the system is designed with security in mind - each request must contain various tokens generated with a combination of AES256 encryption, MD5 and SHA512 hashing of the rest of the request, along with device-provided keys and various state-tracking. 
  * [Infrastructure as Code - Perfect Media Server](https://perfectmediaserver.com/concepts/infraascode.html "Infrastructure as Code - Perfect Media Server") — This simple philosophy of managing configuration in the same way as we do with source code revolutionized the way I approach building systems.
