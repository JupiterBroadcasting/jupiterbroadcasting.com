  * [What is memory safety? ](http://www.pl-enthusiast.net/2014/07/21/memory-safety/ "What is memory safety? ") — For the purposes of this post, we are generally considering whether a program execution is memory safe or not. From this notion, we deem a program to be memory safe if it all of its possible executions are memory safe, and a language to be memory safe if all possible programs in the language are memory safe.

  * [Your Language Sucks, It Doesn’t Matter](https://matklad.github.io//2020/09/13/your-language-sucks.html "Your Language Sucks, It Doesn’t Matter") — The central thesis is that the actual programming language (syntax, semantics, paradigm) doesn’t really matter. What matters is characteristics of the runtime — roughly, what does memory of the running process look like?
  * [Post-Open Source](https://www.boringcactus.com/2020/08/13/post-open-source.html "Post-Open Source") — Imo, open source as a community endeavor is falling apart right before our eyes, and being replaced by open source as Big Corp entrenchment strategy. I mean it’s been happening for a while, but seeing Mozilla sinking like this is just driving the point home for me. FOSS is dead
  * [Microsoft's underwater data center resurfaces after two years](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-54146718 "Microsoft's underwater data center resurfaces after two years") — Their first conclusion is that the cylinder packed with servers had a lower failure rate than a conventional data centre.
