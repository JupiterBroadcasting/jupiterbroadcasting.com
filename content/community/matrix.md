## Spaces and Rooms

Jupiter Broadcasting's Rooms are organized into groups called `spaces` and `sub-spaces`. You join the main JB space to get access to all the rooms, or join a specific sub-space:

- [Jupiter Broadcasting Space][jb-space] - Main space which includes all of the Jupiter Broadcasting rooms and sub-spaces
    - [Community][com-space] - JB community rooms on different topics
    - [Colony Meetups][meet-space] - A sub-space to organize location specific meetups
    - [Coder Radio][cr-space]
    - [Linux Action News][lan-space]
    - [LINUX Unplugged][lup-space]
    - [Self-Hosted][sh-space]

## Element

For any of these links, you will be prompted to choose a Matrix client to proceed with.
Element will be the top option, and is the recommended client for users new to Matrix.
If you have not created a Matrix account, you will be guided through creation on Matrix.org's homeserver.

## Other Clients

Matrix.org maintains [a list of Matrix clients][mx-clients].

Be warned that not all clients have support for spaces.
You may need to log into Element, and join your desired rooms there first.
