  * [LKML: Greg KH: Linux 4.19](https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/10/22/184 "LKML: Greg KH: Linux 4.19") — These past few months has been a tough one for our community, as it is our community that is fighting from within itself, with prodding from others outside of it. Don't fall into the cycle of arguing about those "others" in the "Judean People's Front" when we are the "We're the People's Front of Judea!" That is the trap that countless communities have fallen into over the centuries. We all share the same goal, let us never loose sight of that.
  * [Samsung Open-Source Group Reportedly Shuts Down - Phoronix](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Samsung-Open-Source-Closes "Samsung Open-Source Group Reportedly Shuts Down - Phoronix") — Samsung has apparently shut down the Samsung Open-Source Group (Samsung OSG) as a blow to the wider free software ecosystem considering the group's prolific contributions over the years from low-level open-source projects to desktop/user-facing code-bases. 
  * [You Can Play Over 2,600 Windows Games on Linux Via Steam Play](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/play-windows-games-linux-steam-play,37990.html "You Can Play Over 2,600 Windows Games on Linux Via Steam Play")
  * [ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/news "ProtonDB")
  * [ThinkPad Thunderbolt 3 Workstation Dock](https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/accessories-and-monitors/docking/universal-cable-docks-usb/Thunderbolt-230W-dock-US/p/40AN0230US "ThinkPad Thunderbolt 3 Workstation Dock") — The ThinkPad Thunderbolt 3 WorkStation Dock is a pioneering docking solution powered by Intel Thunderbolt technology and is designed exclusively for ThinkPad Mobile Workstations, delivering up to 230W power to charge both notebook and a full range of productivity and connectivity peripherals. 
  * [System76 Shares With Us More Details On Thelio Open Hardware, Pricing Starts At $1,100 USD](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=system76-thelio-early&num=1 "System76 Shares With Us More Details On Thelio Open Hardware, Pricing Starts At $1,100 USD")
  * [System76 on US Manufacturing and Open Hardware](https://blog.system76.com/post/179592732883/system76-on-us-manufacturing-and-open-hardware "System76 on US Manufacturing and Open Hardware") — To further our open computer ambition, we’re working to remove functionality from the proprietary mainboard. To that end, we designed Thelio Io, a daughter board that manages thermal and chassis control while also providing a storage backplane for the drives in Thelio. It’s open hardware and open source firmware, and a big step in the right direction. 
  * [1 Billion pulls from Docker Hub.](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2018/10/30/1-billion/ "1 Billion pulls from Docker Hub.")
  * [IBM TO ACQUIRE RED HAT](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/ibm-acquire-red-hat-completely-changing-cloud-landscape-and-becoming-worlds-1-hybrid-cloud-provider?intcmp=701f2000000RWK2AAO "IBM TO ACQUIRE RED HAT") — IBM will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Red Hat for $190.00 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $34 billion.
  * [Statement on the IBM acquisition of Red Hat](https://blog.ubuntu.com/2018/10/30/statement-on-ibm-acquisition-of-red-hat "Statement on the IBM acquisition of Red Hat") — Nevertheless, the world has moved on. Replacing UNIX is no longer sufficient. The decline in RHEL growth contrasted with the acceleration in Linux more broadly is a strong market indicator of the next wave of open source. Public cloud workloads have largely avoided RHEL. 
  * [RHEL 7.6 Released](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-refines-hybrid-cloud-innovation-latest-version-world%E2%80%99s-leading-enterprise-linux-platform "RHEL 7.6 Released") — Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 is designed to be the trusted bedrock for hybrid cloud deployments
  * [Announcing the release of Fedora 29](https://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-29/ "Announcing the release of Fedora 29") — This release is particularly exciting because it’s the first to include the Fedora Modularity feature across all our different variants. Modularity lets us ship different versions of packages on the same Fedora base. 
  * [What is Modularity :: Fedora Docs Site](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/modularity/ "What is Modularity :: Fedora Docs Site") — Different users have different needs. Developers want the latest versions possible, system administrators want stability for longer period of time. There are many Linux distributions out there, each targeting a different audience, for example Fedora vs. CentOS.
  * [Working with modules in Fedora](https://fedoramagazine.org/working-modules-fedora-28/ "Working with modules in Fedora") — This article puts one of those modules to practical use, covering installation and setup of Review Board 3.0 using modules.
  * [Blog - Chris Goes to MeetBSD](https://linuxunplugged.com/articles/meetbsd2018 "Blog - Chris Goes to MeetBSD") — MeetBSD 2018 took place at the sprawling Intel Santa Clara campus. The venue itself felt more like an olive branch than a simple friendly gesture by Intel. In truth it felt like a bit of an apology. You get the subtle sense they feel bad about how the BSD's were treated with the Meltdown and Specter flaws.
  * [TAP ROOM For the Ask Noah Party](http://tamaracktaproom.com/ "TAP ROOM For the Ask Noah Party")
  * [Dbxfs - Mount Dropbox Folder Locally As Virtual File System In Linux](https://www.ostechnix.com/dbxfs-mount-dropbox-folder-locally-as-virtual-file-system-in-linux/ "Dbxfs - Mount Dropbox Folder Locally As Virtual File System In Linux") — The dbxfs officially supports Linux and Mac OS. However, it should work on any POSIX system that provides a FUSE-compatible library or has the ability to mount SMB shares.
  * [PSA: Dropbox ext4 limitation workaround](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/9siamu/psa_dropbox_ext4_limitation_workaround/e8p1mll/ "PSA: Dropbox ext4 limitation workaround") — Create a loopback!
  * [TaskBook](https://github.com/klauscfhq/taskbook "TaskBook") — Popey recommended!
