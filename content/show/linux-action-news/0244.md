  * [SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP4 Released - Switches To NVIDIA‚Äôs Open Kernel Driver](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=SUSE-Linux-Enterprise-15-SP4 "SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP4 Released - Switches To NVIDIA‚Äôs Open Kernel Driver") ‚Äî Notable with SLE 15 SP4, SUSE is already switching to using NVIDIA's open-source GPU kernel-mode driver that NVIDIA open-sourced last month
  * [openSUSE Leap 15.4 Released ](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=openSUSE-Leap-15.4 "openSUSE Leap 15.4 Released ")
  * [Element Call Beta 2 includes lots of exciting new updates!](https://element.io/blog/element-call-beta-2-encryption-spatial-audio-walkie-talkie-mode-and-more/ "Element Call Beta 2 includes lots of exciting new updates!") ‚Äî In a walkie-talkie call, videos are disabled, and everyone is muted by default. To speak, press the ‚Äòpush-to-talk‚Äô (PTT) button, either by pressing it on the screen or by holding the spacebar. The catch is that, just like a walkie-talkie or two-way radio, only one person can speak at a time. When someone else is speaking, your PTT button will be disabled, and if you try to push it you‚Äôll hear a warning beep. 
  * [Fedora and Ubuntu EOL announcements](https://lwn.net/Articles/896804/ "Fedora and Ubuntu EOL announcements") ‚Äî If you are running Fedora 34, the time has come to move on; that distribution will reach the end of its support life on June 7. Users of Ubuntu 21.10 have a little longer, but that release loses support on July 14 and users should update to 22.04.
  * [Fedora 34 is going EOL in one week](https://lwn.net/Articles/896806/ "Fedora 34 is going EOL in one week")
  * [Ubuntu 21.10 reaches End of Life on July 14 2022](https://lwn.net/Articles/896805/ "Ubuntu 21.10 reaches End of Life on July 14 2022")
  * [HP Dev One Now Shipping](https://hpdevone.com/#specs "HP Dev One Now Shipping") ‚Äî Unplug and work from any location. At 3.24 lbs, with up to 12 hours of battery life and an ultra-bright display, HP Dev One was made to perform on the go.
  * [Managed PostgreSQL and MongoDB are Here | Linode](https://www.linode.com/blog/databases/mongodb-postgresql-linode-managed-databases/ "Managed PostgreSQL and MongoDB are Here | Linode")
  * [Apple will allow Linux VMs to run Intel apps with Rosetta in macOS Ventura](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/06/macos-ventura-will-extend-rosetta-support-to-linux-virtual-machines/ "Apple will allow Linux VMs to run Intel apps with Rosetta in macOS Ventura") ‚Äî You can even use Rosetta with non-Apple Arm CPUs, though you probably shouldn't.
  * [Running Intel Binaries in Linux VMs with Rosetta](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/virtualization/running_intel_binaries_in_linux_vms_with_rosetta?language=objc "Running Intel Binaries in Linux VMs with Rosetta")
  * [Hector Martin on Twitter](https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1534030476264218624 "Hector Martin on Twitter") ‚Äî ‚ÄúHuh, so Rosetta is now a Linux app. Without Linux kernel patches this can‚Äôt use any special M1 features, so if this runs significantly better than FOSS offerings that should help dispel the myth that ‚Äúthe M1 has magic make-Rosetta-fast features‚Äù. 
  * [Longhorn on Twitter](https://twitter.com/never_released/status/1534127641082593281 "Longhorn on Twitter") ‚Äî Well. Rosetta 2 needs a quite recent CPU (post v8.2) to work because of the instructions used. Does it work on non-Apple arm64 CPUs? ü§î Yes. (allows to settle the argument once and for all that this needs anything Apple specific outside of TSO support*. Answer is a no.)
