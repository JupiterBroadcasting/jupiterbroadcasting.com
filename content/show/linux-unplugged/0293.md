  * [Debian Project Leader Elections 2019: Candidates](https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2019/03/msg00004.html "Debian Project Leader Elections 2019: Candidates") — We're now into the campaigning period. We have 5 candidates.
  * [Linux Laptop Battery Optimization Tool TLP 1.2 Released](https://www.linuxuprising.com/2019/03/linux-battery-optimization-tool-tlp-12.html "Linux Laptop Battery Optimization Tool TLP 1.2 Released") — TLP 1.2 was released today after being in development for more than a year, and it brings support for NVMe, and removable drives like USB and IEEE1394 devices, support for multi queue I/O schedulers (blk-mq), and other significant enhancements.
  * [TLP – Configuration](https://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-configuration.html "TLP – Configuration")
  * [Suse is once again an independent company](https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/15/suse-is-once-again-an-independent-company/ "Suse is once again an independent company") — Few companies have changed hands as often as Suse and yet remained strong players in their business. Suse was first acquired by Novell in 2004. Novell was then acquired by Attachmate in 2010, which Micro Focus acquired in 2014. The company then turned Suse into an independent division, only to then announce its sale to EQT in the middle of 2018.
  * [SUSE is now an independent company after being acquired by EQT for $2.5 billion | Packt Hub](https://hub.packtpub.com/suse-is-now-an-independent-company-after-being-acquired-by-eqt-for-2-5-billion/ "SUSE is now an independent company after being acquired by EQT for $2.5 billion | Packt Hub") — As the company has been owned by EQT, so according to few users it’s still not independent. One of the users commented on HackerNews, “Being owned by a Private Equity fund can really not be described as being “independent”.

The policy has an explicit exception for companion apps (like KDE Connect), but it was removed anyway and *there's no way to talk to Google*

What if you want to do more than just logging calls, e.g. you want to compile statistics on certain behavior? What if you want to trace multiple processes and correlate data from multiple sources? In 2019, there's finally a decent answer to that on Linux: bpftrace, based on eBPF technology.
  * [Learn eBPF Tracing: Tutorial and Examples](http://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2019-01-01/learn-ebpf-tracing.html "Learn eBPF Tracing: Tutorial and Examples") — eBPF can be used for many things: network performance, firewalls, security, tracing, device drivers, and more!
  * [IO Visor Project](https://www.iovisor.org/ "IO Visor Project") — The IO Visor Project is an open source project and a community of developers to accelerate the innovation, development, and sharing of virtualized in-kernel IO services for tracing, analytics, monitoring, security and networking functions. It builds on the Linux community to bring open, flexible, distributed, secure and easy to operate technologies that enable any stack to run efficiently on any physical infrastructure.
  * [IO Visor Project on GitHub](https://github.com/iovisor "IO Visor Project on GitHub") — Organization that hosts the repos for bpftrace, bcc, and other tools.
  * [BCC - Tools for BPF-based Linux IO analysis, networking, monitoring, and more](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc "BCC - Tools for BPF-based Linux IO analysis, networking, monitoring, and more") — BCC is a toolkit for creating efficient kernel tracing and manipulation programs, and includes several useful tools and examples.
