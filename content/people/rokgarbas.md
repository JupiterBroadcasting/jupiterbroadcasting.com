bio: 'Rok is an Engineer at flox and a member of NixOS Marketing team.

  Rok''s journey started with many years of freelance work with Python and DevOps.
  Not being happy with the state of package management at the time, he found Nix in
  2010 and has been a user, a contributor and an advocate since then.

  Wherever he worked he put users first, either as a Release Engineer at Mozilla or
  as a consultant at Tweag. UX/DX became the language to "talk" to the users. Knowing
  that communicating the ideas is as important as having the technical skill is what
  makes Rok stand out. Understanding users and knowing how to talk to them is what
  brings a smile to Rok''s face everyday.

  Rok these days likes to tinker with Rust and is still excited when things work.'
