* [Re: [GIT PULL] bcachefs fixes for 6.11-rc5 - Linus Torvalds](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wj1Oo9-g-yuwWuHQZU8v=VAsBceWCRLhWxy7_-QnSa1Ng@mail.gmail.com/ "Re: \[GIT PULL\] bcachefs fixes for 6.11-rc5 - Linus Torvalds") ‚Äî No one is being jerks here, Linus and I are just sitting in different places with different perspectives. He has a resonsibility as someone managing a huge project to enforce rules as he sees best, while I have a responsibility to support users with working code, and to do that to the best of my abilities.
* [LINUX Unplugged 545: 3,062 Days Later](https://linuxunplugged.com/545 "LINUX Unplugged 545: 3,062 Days Later") ‚Äî Kent Overstreet, the creator of bcachefs, helps us understand where his new filesystem fits, what it's like to upstream a new filesystem, and how they've solved the RAID write hole.
* [Linux is a CNA](http://www.kroah.com/log/blog/2024/02/13/linux-is-a-cna/ "Linux is a CNA") ‚Äî As was recently announced, the Linux kernel project has been accepted as a CNA as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) for vulnerabilities found in Linux.

I've created a simple module for spinning up a podman container running pihole as a systemd service, so that way I can just stick it on any NixOS machine and easily make it my DNS server.
