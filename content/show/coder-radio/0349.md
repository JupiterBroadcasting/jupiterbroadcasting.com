  * [Microsoft proves the critics right: We’re heading toward a Chrome-only Web | Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/03/microsofts-new-skype-for-web-client-an-early-taste-of-the-browser-monoculture/ "Microsoft proves the critics right: We’re heading toward a Chrome-only Web | Ars Technica") — Last week, Microsoft made a major update to the Web version of its Skype client, bringing HD video calling, call recording, and other features already found on the other clients. And as if to prove a point, the update works only in Edge and Chrome. Firefox, Safari, and even Opera are locked out.
  * [The 737Max and Why Software Engineers Might Want to Pay Attention](https://medium.com/@jpaulreed/the-737max-and-why-software-engineers-should-pay-attention-a041290994bd "The 737Max and Why Software Engineers Might Want to Pay Attention") — What is different here is: the MCAS commands the trim in this condition without notifying the pilots AND to override the input, the pilots must deactivate the system via a switch on a console, NOT by retrimming the aircraft via the yoke, which is a more common way to manage the airplane’s trim.
  * [How a 50-year-old design came back to haunt Boeing with its troubled 737 Max jet - Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-fi-boeing-max-design-20190315-story.html "How a 50-year-old design came back to haunt Boeing with its troubled 737 Max jet - Los Angeles Times") — The crisis comes after 50 years of remarkable success in making the 737 a profitable workhorse. Today, the aerospace giant has a massive backlog of more than 4,700 orders for the jetliner and its sales account for nearly a third of Boeing’s profit. But the decision to continue modernizing the jet, rather than starting at some point with a clean design, resulted in engineering challenges that created unforeseen risks.

Here's my response: It's not a software problem. 
  * [Timeline - Time to Play Fair](https://www.timetoplayfair.com/timeline/ "Timeline - Time to Play Fair") — Apple’s behavior isn’t new. In fact, there are countless times over the years that demonstrate that they don’t play fair. 
  * [Addressing Spotify’s Claims - Apple](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/03/addressing-spotifys-claims/ "Addressing Spotify’s Claims - Apple") — At its core, the App Store is a safe, secure platform where users can have faith in the apps they discover and the transactions they make. And developers, from first-time engineers to larger companies, can rest assured that everyone is playing by the same set of rules.
  * [Introduction to Python Development at Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com/devops/training/course/name/intro-to-python-development "Introduction to Python Development at Linux Academy") — This course is designed to teach you how to program using Python.
