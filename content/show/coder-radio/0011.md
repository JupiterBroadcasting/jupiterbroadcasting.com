#### Feedback

  * Cole is doing some Django but is wondering if ROR generates enough HTML/JS that he would not have to fiddle with it if he used ROR.
  * [Chris writes in to share some QT deployment wisdom and to share his current OSS project: personal audio server](http://www.streampublic.com/index.html)
  * Macarthur writes us a letter in C/C++ and took extra care to have it compile on compilers and machines. Also,has some interesting ideas on OO.
  * Macarthur (maybe same dude?) writes in to tell us that he has great success with Clang+LLVM for debugging but releases uses GCC.
  * [Forlian writes in to share his success with Pomodoro and shares an extension for GNOME](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/53/pomodoro/index.html)
  * Daniel asks about design patterns and needs a jumping off place for research.
  * Nick is using D with QT but is having a hard time configuring QTD. Also, some clarifications on Mike C++ and Java.
  * Jason’s Email — Jason has a tough choice to make. Oh and he made me build his email with Ant — Java fans REJOICE!
  * Ewoud writes in to remind us that there a lot of embedded developers out there working in C and to offer Bill (our aspiring Linux dev) some encouragement. Oh Also, he has robotics experience, so when the robots take over — blame him.
