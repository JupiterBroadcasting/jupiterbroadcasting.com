  * [Security Disclosure 2: vulnerabilities in custom integrations HACS, Font Awesome and others - Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2021/01/23/security-disclosure2/ "Security Disclosure 2: vulnerabilities in custom integrations HACS, Font Awesome and others - Home Assistant") — Multiple custom integrations were found that allowed an attacker to steal any file without logging in.

Ultimately, I decided to continue for now, because there were at least some users who didn't mind, and if I stopped, someone else would start over and run blindly into this problem.
