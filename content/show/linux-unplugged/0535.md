  * [Element Going AGPL](https://twitter.com/element_hq/status/1721514509238489490 "Element Going AGPL") ‚Äî üì£‚ö†Ô∏èüì£ Announcing a new home and license (AGPLv3) for Synapse and friends: going forwards Element‚Äôs work on Synapse, Dendrite & related server-side projects is going to be released as AGPLv3 rather than Apache.
  * [A new home and license (AGPL) for Synapse and friends](https://element.io/blog/element-to-adopt-agplv3/ "A new home and license \(AGPL\) for Synapse and friends") ‚Äî The benefit of switching to AGPLv3 is that it obliges downstream developers to contribute back to the core project - either by releasing their modifications as open source for the benefit of the whole Matrix ecosystem, or by contacting Element for an alternative license. Future code contributors to Synapse will need to sign a contributor license agreement (CLA) based on the Apache Software Foundation‚Äôs CLA, giving Element the right to license the contribution commercially to third party proprietary forks so we can use it to help fund Matrix core development in future.
