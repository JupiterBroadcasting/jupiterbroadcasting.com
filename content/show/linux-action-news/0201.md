  * [Google Calls On Companies To Devote More Engineers To Upstream Linux, Toolchains](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Google-Security-More-Engineers "Google Calls On Companies To Devote More Engineers To Upstream Linux, Toolchains") — The post notes that stable Linux kernel releases see close to 100 new fixes each week, but given that rate of change vendors are not always picking up the latest fixes or in some cases just trying to cherry-pick the "important" fixes. Besides acknowledging the need for more upstream kernel developers, the post also encourages vendors to go the route of chasing the latest Linux stable or LTS kernel releases in order to incorporate all fixes.

  * [Intel Proposes Linux Kernel Driver Allow/Deny Filtering](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-Driver-Filtering-Option "Intel Proposes Linux Kernel Driver Allow/Deny Filtering") — Given the VMM is an untrusted entity and the VMM presents emulated hardware to the guest, a threat vector similar to Thunderclap [1] is present. Also, for ease of deployment, it is useful to be able to use the same kernel binary on host and guest, but that presents a wide attack surface given the range of hardware supported in typical builds.
