  "description": "Is it time to reboot the big development conferences? We contrast WWDC to a community focused event like LinuxFest Northwest and attempt to answer the value question behind the larger conferences, why pressing the flesh can be important, and if Google Hangouts can be part of the solution. Plus working from home tricks, making the switch from a 9-5 job to contracting, the start of the great app exit, and does using Chrome make you against the free web?",
