I don't think denying a mascot it's vacation is legal. I consider founding the first podcast mascot union to make sure podcast mascot's rights are respected and not eradicated.
  * [Workplace Productivity: Are You Being Tracked? - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/14/business/worker-productivity-tracking.html "Workplace Productivity: Are You Being Tracked? - The New York Times") — Across industries and incomes, more employees are being tracked, recorded and ranked. What is gained, companies say, is efficiency and accountability. What is lost?
  * [Archive.org: The Rise of the Worker Productivity Score](http://web.archive.org/web/20220815021317/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/14/business/worker-productivity-tracking.html "Archive.org: The Rise of the Worker Productivity Score") — Now digital productivity monitoring is also spreading among white-collar jobs and roles that require graduate degrees. Many employees, whether working remotely or in person, are subject to trackers, scores, “idle” buttons, or just quiet, constantly accumulating records. Pauses can lead to penalties, from lost pay to lost jobs.
  * [Stof's thoughts on tabs or Spaces](https://paste.docs.lol/reader/EnforcesAurelias "Stof's thoughts on tabs or Spaces") — Essentially, tabs are idealistic and would win any argument not based on real world 'not caring' of humans, so in reality spaces win, but how many spaces is a better question! I wonder what the audience would say about 2 spaces?
  * [West Coast Crew Chat](https://bit.ly/westcoastcrew "West Coast Crew Chat") — Join our west coast locals chan room.
  * [Want to join us at JPL?](https://nextcloud.tuxies.party/apps/forms/FjFmqmReikJH2BwR "Want to join us at JPL?") — Put your name in the hat, just be sure you can be there Sept 29th!

  * [RCE Vulnerability found in Electron](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/wmpchx/comment/ik32z40 "RCE Vulnerability found in Electron") — This occurs because of the way ElectronJS is designed and is a fundamental design issue within the framework. (ElectronJs = JS + Chromium so this intersection is where the flaw occurs as it’s not same as your normal chrome browser).

  * [Apple asked for a cut of Facebook’s ad sales years before it stifled Facebook’s ad sales](https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/12/23303095/apple-meta-facebook-ad-sales-subscription "Apple asked for a cut of Facebook’s ad sales years before it stifled Facebook’s ad sales") — Apple reportedly argued that it deserved a cut of certain portions of Facebook’s ad revenue.

Then, ATT denials don't hold water. – Stratechery by Ben Thompson

  * [Patrick Moorhead #SixFiveSummit on Twitter](https://twitter.com/patrickmoorhead/status/1558878168685154306 "Patrick Moorhead #SixFiveSummit on Twitter") — What an Apple power move: Hobble the advertising efforts of your ecosystem and then start monetizing the real estate yourself. Redefines vertical integration. Truly brilliant.
