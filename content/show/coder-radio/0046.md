### Show Notes:

#### Feedback

 **Daniel Gee:**

> I've heard that if the requirements of a codebase shift more than 25% or so,
> it becomes faster to start from scratch than to﻿ try to update the code.
> Greg Wilson brought it up in his talk _"What We Actually Know About Software
> Development, and Why We Believe It's True"_. Basically, the most costly part
> of coding isn't the coding, it's the nailing down the requirements. Once you
> have those, starting over is relatively cheap.

  * [No, the market is not fine](http://blog.mdominick.com/index99a3.html?p=422\\%22)

> Like Arment, I agree that the bar is higher for apps than it was just a few
> years ago, but I contend that the bar being higher is a problem for the
> average independent developer. Many of these developers simply do not have
> the capital required to hire a decent designer and effectively market an
> app.
