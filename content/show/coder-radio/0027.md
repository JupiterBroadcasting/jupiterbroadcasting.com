#### Feedback

  * Chris writes in:

> “When I referenced "beauty" I meant the design of C++ as a language, and how
> one can write in it very freely.”

  * A web developer wants to know why we hate Firefox and sees a trend for web devs to focus on webKit.
  * Jason asks:

> So, here is where I am really stuck. How do you sit down and design
> something like a game? What tips would you give for actually laying out the
> design of the code, and the UI that you need? I come from a heavy web
> background, and have been doing mostly procedural languages for the past 10
> years. I have the training in OO, but haven't been using the skills.
>
> Mostly, I'm curious about the design side of apps and gaming. How do you do
> this so it doesn't take on a life of its own, but still gives me the
> direction I need to move forward?”
