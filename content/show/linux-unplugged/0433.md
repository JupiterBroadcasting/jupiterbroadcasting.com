  * [Kodi “Matrix” 19.3 Release](https://kodi.tv/article/kodi-matrix-19-3-release/ "Kodi “Matrix” 19.3 Release") — Okay, we know that we've only just released 19.2, and some of you are probably even still waiting for that, but that's a big part of the reason we need to push out a new build. We still had some challenges with the Xbox release, and some other issues came to light that we didn't want to ignore - so, rather than get into platform-specific point releases, we thought we'd just nudge up to 19.3 and go for it.
  * [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/ "Jellyfin") — Jellyfin is the volunteer-built media solution that puts you in control of your media. Stream to any device from your own server, with no strings attached. Your media, your server, your way.

This board is ideal for HTPC makers, Linux developers, software router enthusiasts, and the majority of regular Raspberry Pi users.
