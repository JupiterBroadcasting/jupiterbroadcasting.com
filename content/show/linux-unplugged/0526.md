  * [Making life (even) harder for proprietary modules](https://lwn.net/Articles/939842/ "Making life \(even\) harder for proprietary modules") ‚Äî It changes the behavior of symbol_get(), causing it to fail when asked to look up a symbol that is not marked GPL-only. This is an inversion of the usual test, which denies access to symbols that are marked GPL-only. The reasoning is that symbol_get() has always been intended for low-level cooperation deep within the kernel, where everything is expected to be GPL-only anyway.
  * [Linux 6.6 To Better Protect Against The Illicit Behavior Of NVIDIA‚Äôs Proprietary Driver](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.6-Illicit-NVIDIA-Change "Linux 6.6 To Better Protect Against The Illicit Behavior Of NVIDIA‚Äôs Proprietary Driver") ‚Äî Back in 2020 when the original defense was added, NVIDIA recommended avoiding the Linux 5.9 for the time being. They ended up having a supported driver several weeks later. It will be interesting to see this time how long Linux 6.6+ thwarts their kernel driver.
