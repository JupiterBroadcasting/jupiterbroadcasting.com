  * [Fedora 31 Isn't Expected To Be Delayed After All](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Fedora-31-No-Delayed-Release "Fedora 31 Isn't Expected To Be Delayed After All") — Since November the developers behind Fedora Linux had been discussing whether to significantly delay or even cancel Fedora 31 so they could spend around one year working on re-tooling how the distribution is crafted and work on other fundamental changes.

  * [Linux 5.0 is on the way](https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-5-is-on-the-way/ "Linux 5.0 is on the way") — The numbering change is not indicative of anything special. If you want to have an official reason, it's that I ran out of fingers and toes to count on, so 4.21 became 5.0
