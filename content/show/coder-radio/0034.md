#### Feedback

  * Notbryant is taking “Intro to Software Engineering” and is learning about project management and asks for “any advice on not being an evil PM”
  * Jimmy has a problem:

> “I tend to get too serious about too many projects at the same time.

> an application, almost at completion, but now my Raspberry Pi has arrived.
> Sigh.”
