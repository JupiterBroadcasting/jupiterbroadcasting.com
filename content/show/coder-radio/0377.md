  * [Upgrading GitHub to Ruby 2.7 - The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/2020-08-25-upgrading-github-to-ruby-2-7/ "Upgrading GitHub to Ruby 2.7 - The GitHub Blog") — Falling behind on Ruby upgrades has drastic negative effects on the stability of your codebase. Upgrading Ruby supports your application health, improves performance, fixes language and framework bugs, and guides the future of the language!

  * [Michael Dominick on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dominucco/status/1300129942341025792?s=12 "Michael Dominick on Twitter") — #iOSDev what do you feel about the #AppStore rules? Is the problem the 30% or the restrictions on what you can build? I’m thinking especially of #iPad here. Sound off on this tweet thread.
  * [Hope you didn’t delete Fortnite or Infinity Blade because Apple just terminated Epic’s dev account](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406013/apple-epic-games-fortnite-developer-account-terminated-no-longer-available "Hope you didn’t delete Fortnite or Infinity Blade because Apple just terminated Epic’s dev account") — You can’t re-download Epic games anymore
  * [Apple apologizes to WordPress, won’t force the free app to add purchases after all](https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4 "Apple apologizes to WordPress, won’t force the free app to add purchases after all") — “We [...] apologize for any confusion that we have caused”
  * [Apple Confirms New App Store Policies on Bug Fix Updates and Challenging Guidelines Are Live](https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/31/app-store-bug-fixes-guideline-challenges/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4 "Apple Confirms New App Store Policies on Bug Fix Updates and Challenging Guidelines Are Live") — For apps that are already on the ‌App Store‌, bug fixes will no longer be delayed over guideline violations except for those related to legal issues. You'll instead be able to address guideline violations in your next submission. And now, in addition to appealing decisions about whether an app violates guidelines, you can suggest changes to the guidelines. We also encourage you to submit your ‌App Store‌ and Apple development platform suggestions so we can continue to improve experiences for the developer community.
