  * [All the best engineering advice I stole from non-technical people](https://medium.com/@bellmar/all-the-best-engineering-advice-i-stole-from-non-technical-people-eb7f90ca2f5f "All the best engineering advice I stole from non-technical people") — As I focus on becoming a better manager of engineers, I have been reflecting more and more on the advice that produced a 10X boost in my abilities at that same stage. More often than not the best advice, the things that stuck with me, came from people who had no background at all in software. 
  * [Overview of Docker Compose | Docker Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/ "Overview of Docker Compose | Docker Documentation") — Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. 
  * [Podman](https://podman.io/ "Podman") — What is Podman? Podman is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers on your Linux System. Containers can either be run as root or in rootless mode. Simply put: `alias docker=podman`.

So here are mine and the issues we ran into along the way.
