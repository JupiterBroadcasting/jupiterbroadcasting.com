Being unable to do so is like a cavalry captain who can’t ride a horse.”
  * [FiniteSingularity on Twitter](https://twitter.com/finitesingulrty/status/1596900597298786304?s=46&t=1NbrB6pe5PuC77EG2C2pvQ "FiniteSingularity on Twitter") — Pro Tip- dont update XCode via the software update app, but rather manually download the pkg from the Apple developer downloads page. It downloads/installs *much* more quickly.
  * [pyenv: Simple Python version management](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv "pyenv: Simple Python version management") — pyenv lets you easily switch between multiple versions of Python. It's simple, unobtrusive, and follows the UNIX tradition of single-purpose tools that do one thing well.
