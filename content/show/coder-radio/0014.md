#### Feedback

  * Mike does not mean free software when he says open source — he means open source…
  * Michael wants to know if I think that Macs have become popular with developers because that is what their employers buy — ie would they spend the same money themselves?
  * Kostas writes in re the open-source business models: “In my opinion the only people who can afford to experiment with this are people whose lives don't depend on the revenue from their software. That leaves just hobbyists and college students”
  * Mike has been learning Python and wants to know what GUI toolkit to use
  * David needs to buy a new PC and wants to know if I recommend a laptop or desktop.
  * Brian suggests we cover the JVM languages that are not Java and wonders what I think of the idea that Scala will replace Java
  * Regarding GO.
