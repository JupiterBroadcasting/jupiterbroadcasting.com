## Episode links

  * [Yo, Thelio! - dominickm.com](http://dominickm.com/yo-thelio/ "Yo, Thelio! - dominickm.com") — Overall, I am very happy with Thelio and if you’re interesting in running Linux on a desktop full-time, I recommend you consider it.
  * [Michael Dominick on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dominucco/status/1095823064745607170 "Michael Dominick on Twitter") — 10 minutes in and the #DarterPro has the best non-Mac trackpad I’ve ever used.
  * [Michael Dominick on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dominucco/status/1097424480022994944 "Michael Dominick on Twitter") — Yeah, so @ChrisLAS I have fallen hard off the old man sleep wagon and it's deeply sub-optimal.
  * [SCaLE 17x](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/17x "SCaLE 17x") — SCaLE is the largest community-run open-source and free software conference in North America. It is held annually in the greater Los Angeles area.
  * [C# 8: The switch expression](https://alexatnet.com/cs8-switch-statement/ "C# 8: The switch expression") — C# 8 delivers a few new C# features to developers, and it is nice to see the language improving, but today I would like to talk about only one and it is "switch expressions".
  * [Don’t Get Clever with Login Forms | Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/dont-get-clever-with-login-forms/ "Don’t Get Clever with Login Forms | Brad Frost") — Let’s walk through some login patterns and why I think they’re not ideal. And then let’s look at some better ways of tackling login.
  * [Canonical Announces Latest Ubuntu Core for IoT » Linux Magazine](http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/News/Canonical-Announces-Latest-Ubuntu-Core-for-IoT "Canonical Announces Latest Ubuntu Core for IoT » Linux Magazine") — Canonical has announced Ubuntu Core 18, their open source platform for IoT devices. Ubuntu Core 18 is based on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS code-base and will be supported for 10 years. 
  * [Andrew Madsen on Twitter](https://twitter.com/armadsen/status/1096881835093544962?s=12 "Andrew Madsen on Twitter") — It’s weird how the iOS community has shifted so much from “iOS development” to “Swift”. 5 years on, and a huge part of what everyone’s doing revolves around the language, not how to create great apps. Why is that? 
  * [Michael Dominick on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dominucco/status/1097178374756319233 "Michael Dominick on Twitter") — Thinking more about this conversation about how the #iOSDev #macOs scene has changed online, it occurs to me that there’s a platform where that past ethos of “just build cool things” lives — desktop #Linux and @elementary in particular #CoderRadio @ChrisLAS 
  * [16-Inch MacBook Pro With All-New Design Expected in 2019](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/02/17/16-inch-macbook-pro-2019-kuo/ "16-Inch MacBook Pro With All-New Design Expected in 2019") — Kuo also says Apple may add a 32GB RAM option to the 13-inch MacBook Pro, without providing further details.
