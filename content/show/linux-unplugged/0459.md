  * [HP Dev One](https://hpdevone.com/ "HP Dev One") — Get ready for a laptop that’s customized for the way you code. Featuring preinstalled Pop!_OS Linux and a tuned Linux keyboard with a Super key, HP Dev One was designed with developers in mind.
  * [HP Preparing An AMD-Powered Linux Laptop Powered By Pop!_OS](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=HP-Dev-One "HP Preparing An AMD-Powered Linux Laptop Powered By Pop!_OS")
  * [HP teamed up with System76 for the HP Dev One laptop with Pop!_OS Linux](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2022/05/hp-teamed-up-with-system76-for-the-hp-dev-one-laptop-with-pop-os-linux/ "HP teamed up with System76 for the HP Dev One laptop with Pop!_OS Linux")
  * [Bringing bcachefs to the mainline](https://lwn.net/Articles/895266/ "Bringing bcachefs to the mainline") — Bcachefs is a longstanding out-of-tree filesystem that grew out of the bcache caching layer that has been in the kernel for nearly ten years. Based on a session led by Kent Overstreet at the 2022 Linux Storage, Filesystem, Memory-management and BPF Summit (LSFMM), though, it would seem that bcachefs is likely to be heading upstream soon. He intends to start the process toward mainline inclusion over the next six months or so.

  * [Pick: Briar](https://briarproject.org/ "Pick: Briar") — Secure messaging, anywhere.
