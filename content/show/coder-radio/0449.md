  * [Dare Obasanjo on Twitter](https://twitter.com/carnage4life/status/1483110305932537858 "Dare Obasanjo on Twitter") — Apple’s approach to allowing 3rd party payments for IAPs in Netherlands will follow Google’s approach in South Korea. Developers will still need to pay Apple a fee even if they use Stripe,etc. Google reduced their fee by 4% meaning there’s zero benefit.
  * [Dare Obasanjo on Twitter](https://twitter.com/carnage4life/status/1483110315545948160 "Dare Obasanjo on Twitter") — Apple & Google are going to tell developers “Fine instead of 30%, the fee is now 26% and after giving Stripe 2.9% + 30¢ plus a worse UX, you’ll be worse off”. This is a diabolical way to meet the letter but not the spirit of laws. World class legal judo.
