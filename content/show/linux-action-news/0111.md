  * [Ubuntu to drop i386 architecture](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/i386-architecture-will-be-dropped-starting-with-eoan-ubuntu-19-10/11263 "Ubuntu to drop i386 architecture") — he Ubuntu engineering team has reviewed the facts before us and concluded that we should not continue to carry i386 forward as an architecture. Consequently, i386 will not be included as an architecture for the 19.10 release, and we will shortly begin the process of disabling it for the eoan series across Ubuntu infrastructure.
  * [Proposal: Let's drop i386 May 9th 2018](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2018-May/040310.html "Proposal: Let's drop i386 May 9th 2018")
  * [Proposal: Let's drop i386 May 14th 2018](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2018-May/040348.html "Proposal: Let's drop i386 May 14th 2018")
  * [Wine devs worried](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Wine-Unsure-Ubuntu-32-Bit "Wine devs worried") — "I think not building packages for Ubuntu 19.10 would be the only practical option. It would probably be good to have a small explanation on the download page though. As I understand it, it would still be possible to run 32-bit executables on the Ubuntu 19.10 kernel, but we'd have to build and ship all our dependencies ourselves. I don't think we want to go there just yet." 
  * [At least some games not working without 32-bit](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/results-of-testing-3rd-party-applications-on-64-bit-only-eoan-19-10/11353 "At least some games not working without 32-bit") — Further to the recent announcement and subsequent discussion, I did a little testing over lunch on eoan 19.10 with all i386 packages removed and the i386 part of the repo disabled.
  * [Ubuntu NOT “dropping support for i386 applications”](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/i386-architecture-will-be-dropped-starting-with-eoan-ubuntu-19-10/11263/84 "Ubuntu NOT “dropping support for i386 applications”") — What we are dropping is updates to the i386 libraries, which will be frozen at the 18.04 LTS versions. But there is every intention to ensure that there is a clear story for how i386 applications (including games) can be run on versions of Ubuntu later than 19.10.
  * [Petition · Dont remove 32 bit support in the next version of Ubuntu](https://www.change.org/p/canonical-canonical-dont-remove-32-bit-support-in-the-next-version-of-ubuntu "Petition · Dont remove 32 bit support in the next version of Ubuntu")

  * [New vulnerabilities may let hackers remotely SACK Linux and FreeBSD systems](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/06/new-vulnerabilities-may-let-hackers-remotely-sack-linux-and-freebsd-systems/ "New vulnerabilities may let hackers remotely SACK Linux and FreeBSD systems") — Netflix researchers discovered 4 flaws that could wreak havoc in data centers.

  * [Mattermost raises $50M](https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/19/mattermost-raises-50-million-to-advance-its-open-source-slack-alternative/ "Mattermost raises $50M") — The capital infusion follows a $20 million series A in February and a $3.5 million seed round in February 2017 and brings the Palo Alto, California-based company’s total raised to roughly $70 million.
  * [Google says it’s done making tablets](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/20/18693399/google-abandoning-tablets-pixel-slate-failure "Google says it’s done making tablets") — The Pixel Slate won’t get a sequel, but the Pixelbook will
  * [Facebook's Libra confirmed](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/20/18693521/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-calibra-explainer-how-does-work-features "Facebook's Libra confirmed") — Facebook is planning to launch a cryptocurrency it hopes will “transform the global economy.”
