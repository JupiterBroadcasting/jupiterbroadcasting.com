  * Mike is developing an HTML5 tool and asks if we feel the Apple Mac App Store is more profitable than the Chrome Webstore and WinRT Store combined.

  * Spindl — Zane’s new Ubuntu app:https://zaneswafford.com/hamburger/ AKA Hamburger project

  * Matt asks what we think of Openshift v Heroku and if we think Google is likely to kill Go

  * Trond asks if he should use C or C++ for an OSS library

  * Michael bought a year of Godaddy using our code (nice) and wonders what PHP MVC framework he should try

  * Chris asks if we think Xbox One will have an XNA like SDK — if so what will it be?

### Ouya Review

  * [Ouya review: can an indie console take on Sony and Microsoft? | The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review/index.html)

> Let's say everything goes exactly right for Ouya. Every good game in the
> Play Store becomes available to Ouya, Netflix and Amazon decide to play nice
> with the device, and the ROM and hacker community explode and make every app
> and many more available to the nascent platform. Then and only then, Ouya
> can be viable — if it can combine a decent set-top box with a decent gaming
> platform, it may have a case to make for your $99. But those are a lot of
> cards that have to fall a particular way, and without them the Ouya is a lot
> more like a Raspberry Pi than an Xbox 360.

  * [This is OUYA! – IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/16/this-is-ouya/index.html)

> Anyway that was my experience with the console. It's still early, but the
> platform seems to be shaping up nicely. Only time will tell if it can
> actually grab the attention of gamers everywhere.

  * [Ouya: The infinite garage sale | Joystiq](http://www.joystiq.com/2013/04/17/ouya-kickstarter-review/index.html)

> It's difficult not to weigh the Ouya's current shortcomings against all of
> its grand, much-publicized promise, but all of that grandiosity has to be
> reconciled with an important fact: The Ouya costs $99. Even if competent
> mobile ports are the best games the Ouya ever gets, that's an incredibly low
> barrier of entry for consumers and developers alike. How many good games
> does it take to be considered a good return on a $99 investment? One? Five?
> 10?

### XBox One For Devs

  * [Is Microsoft abandoning indie game developers with the Xbox One? – NBC News.com](http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/microsoft-abandoning-indie-game-developers-xbox-one-6C10037826/index.html)

> So the leaders of the indie game community clearly weren't thrilled by the
> Xbox One reveal. But does that mean that Microsoft is hanging them out to
> dry? Possibly. An independent developer who has worked with Microsoft in the
> past told NBC News that "premium" has become something of a buzzword for the
> company's new console, as if to emphasize that the company wants to maintain
> a strong hand in curating all gaming content that appears on XBLA.

> A few developers have weighed in on the Xbox One reveal, with many citing
> confusion over why we have to have Kinect 2 enabled all the time, and why
> the main focus was on the television aspect of the console — and not the
> games.

> Microsoft on Thursday revealed new details about its "NUads," which are
> coming to Xbox Live this fall. NUads are interactive advertisements that put
> the Kinect's motion-sensing and voice-detecting abilities to work.
