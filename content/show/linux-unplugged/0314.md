  * [Continuous integration testing for the Linux kernel | Opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/19/6/continuous-kernel-integration-linux "Continuous integration testing for the Linux kernel | Opensource.com") — The call for continuous integration (CI) grows for more and more projects, the Continuous Kernel Integration (CKI) team forges ahead with a single mission: prevent bugs from being merged into the kernel.
  * [Major's Continuous Kernel Integration Talk at Texas Linuxfe 2019](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1T0JaRA0wtDU0aTWTyASwwy_ugtzjUcw_ZDmC5KFzw-A/edit#slide=id.p "Major's Continuous Kernel Integration Talk at Texas Linuxfe 2019")

  * [0-Day Continuous Integration (CI) Test Service from Intel](https://01.org/blogs/2018/0-day-ci-test "0-Day Continuous Integration \(CI\) Test Service from Intel") — With so much code contributed to each release, it’s impossible to avoid potential regressions. To eliminate them, you must first find the bugs that cause them, which can be like finding a needle in the proverbial haystack. This is what makes the 0-Day Continuous Integration (CI) Test Service so important. 0-Day delivers comprehensive, automated and continuous integration testing that monitors the Linux mainline and 800+ developer trees for regressions, helping find bugs before they reach the Linux kernel so problems can be fixed before they impact users. Simply put, 0-Day helps ensure Linux kernel quality in a highly complex development environment.
  * [Snowpatch: continuous-integration testing for the kernel](https://lwn.net/Articles/777421/ "Snowpatch: continuous-integration testing for the kernel") — The Linux kernel project lags many others in its use of CI testing for a number of reasons, including a fundamental mismatch with how kernel developers tend to manage their workflows. At linux.conf.au 2019, Russell Currey described a CI system called Snowpatch that, he hopes, will bridge the gap and bring better testing to the kernel development process.
  * [Kernel CI Dashboard — FAQ](https://kernelci.org/faq/ "Kernel CI Dashboard — FAQ")
  * [Linux Test Project](https://github.com/linux-test-project/ltp "Linux Test Project") — Linux Test Project is a joint project started by SGI, OSDL and Bull developed and maintained by IBM, Cisco, Fujitsu, SUSE, Red Hat, Oracle and others. The project goal is to deliver tests to the open source community that validate the reliability, robustness, and stability of Linux. 
  * [patchwork](http://jk.ozlabs.org/projects/patchwork/ "patchwork") — Patchwork is a web-based patch tracking system designed to facilitate the contribution and management of contributions to an open-source project. 
  * [Kernel Patch-Evaluated Testing](https://github.com/CKI-project/kpet/ "Kernel Patch-Evaluated Testing") — KPET is a framework which will execute targeted testing based on changes introduced in the patch, e.g. a network driver or similar would trigger network related testing to be invoked, or a filesystem change would invoke filesystem testing.

  * [openQA | Introduction to the heart of openSUSE's automated testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2K6ZmvIOtPw "openQA | Introduction to the heart of openSUSE's automated testing") — OpenSUSE is way too versatile for humans to test even the most common configurations. Therefore openQA was introduced and became an indispensable part of the openSUSE development and release processes. openQA is an automated test tool for operating systems. It allows to test the whole installation process of an operating system in a wide range of software and hardware configurations by leveraging qemu. This talk gives an introduction to openQA and explains how openQA works to help understand what it's output means.
  * [OpenQA - Fedora Project Wiki](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/OpenQA "OpenQA - Fedora Project Wiki") — Fedora uses the openQA automated testing system as a significant part of the release validation testing process, and for testing updates. On this page you can find more information about openQA, how Fedora uses it, and how to install your own instance of openQA so you can try it out and contribute to test development.
