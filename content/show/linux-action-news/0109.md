  * [Firefox Now Available with Enhanced Tracking Protection by Default](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/06/04/firefox-now-available-with-enhanced-tracking-protection-by-default/ "Firefox Now Available with Enhanced Tracking Protection by Default") — At Firefox, we’re doing more than that. We believe that in order to truly protect people, we need to establish a new standard that puts people’s privacy first.
  * [Relicensing CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/oss-relicensing-cockroachdb/ "Relicensing CockroachDB") — But our past outlook on the right business model relied on a crucial norm in the OSS world: that companies could build a business around a strong open source core product without a much larger technology platform company coming along and offering the same product as a service. That norm no longer holds. 
  * [Microsoft and Oracle link up their clouds](https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/05/microsoft-and-oracle-link-up-their-clouds/ "Microsoft and Oracle link up their clouds") — Microsoft and Oracle announced a new alliance today that will see the two companies directly connect their clouds over a direct network connection so that their users can then move workloads and data seamlessly between the two. 
  * [Google is fighting to keep doing business with Huawei](https://www.businessinsider.com/google-is-fighting-to-keep-doing-business-with-huawei-2019-6 "Google is fighting to keep doing business with Huawei") — Three sources told the Financial Times that Google's argument is that cutting ties with Huawei could pose a national security risk.
  * [Stadia details announced](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/google-stadia-requires-130-upfront-10-per-month-at-november-launch/ "Stadia details announced") — Stadia games run on custom Linux-based server hardware maintained by Google, promising "10.7 teraflops of power in each instance." Game audio and video is streamed from those servers to a user's device, and inputs are streamed from the user to the server over a network of what Google says are "7,500 edge nodes" around the world.
