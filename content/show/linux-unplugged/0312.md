### Episode Links

  * [ThinkTiny](https://liliputing.com/2019/07/thinktiny-mini-laptop-sports-a-1-inch-display-pointing-nub-diy-project.html "ThinkTiny") — The ThinkTiny is a miniature laptop computer with a 0.96 inch display and a design that’s heavily inspired by Lenovo/IBM ThinkPad style. There’s even a TrackPoint-like pointing nub. 
  * [Darling Picks Up New Contributors For Its macOS Compatibility Layer On Linux](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Darling-2019-New-Contribs "Darling Picks Up New Contributors For Its macOS Compatibility Layer On Linux") — Darling is the long-standing (albeit for some years idling) effort to allow macOS binaries to run on Linux that is akin to Wine but focused on an Apple macOS layer rather than Windows. This summer it's been moving along and seeing some new developer contributions. 
  * [Darling Progress Report Q2 2019](http://blog.darlinghq.org/2019/07/darling-progress-report-q2-2019.html "Darling Progress Report Q2 2019") — We are very excited to say that in Q2 2019 (April 1 to June 30) we saw more community involvement than ever before. Many pull requests were submitted that spanned from bug fixes for our low level assembly to higher level modules such as the AppKit framework. Thanks to everyone for your contributions and we hope for this level of engagement to continue. 
  * [Raspberry Pi 4 Desktop Kit](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-desktop-kit/ "Raspberry Pi 4 Desktop Kit") — Full desktop computer kit - just connect to HDMI display(s) 
  * [Raspberry Pi 4 on sale now from $35](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-4-on-sale-now-from-35/ "Raspberry Pi 4 on sale now from $35") — A 1.5GHz quad-core 64-bit ARM Cortex-A72 CPU (~3× performance) 
  * [Raspberry Pi 4 Ubuntu Server 18.04.2 Install / Config Guide](https://jamesachambers.com/raspberry-pi-ubuntu-server-18-04-2-installation-guide/ "Raspberry Pi 4 Ubuntu Server 18.04.2 Install / Config Guide") — Right now there is a memory limitation of 1 GB in 64 bit mode on the Raspberry Pi 4. This is apparently due to the SD card driver breaking when more than 1 GB of RAM is present. This will all be solved eventually but until then I recommend using the 32 bit version of Ubuntu or waiting until the Raspberry Pi 4 support catches up. If you want to run the 64 bit one now anyway it works fine other than the memory limitation. 
  * [Raspberry Pi 4 on Arch Linux ARM](https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv8/broadcom/raspberry-pi-4 "Raspberry Pi 4 on Arch Linux ARM")
  * [Fedora 30 - Rasbberry Pi 4 support - arm - Fedora Mailing-Lists](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/arm@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/OFIGDPUDFOA3BB33GVCDHTSGZ2Q77APK/ "Fedora 30 - Rasbberry Pi 4 support - arm - Fedora Mailing-Lists")
  * [Manjaro announces partnership, will start shipping closed source FreeOffice suite by default](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/cjrkfs/manjaro_announces_partnership_will_start_shipping/ "Manjaro announces partnership, will start shipping closed source FreeOffice suite by default") — Additionally we ship FreeOffice 491 by default. This is possible since we partnered up with Softmaker 70.

  * [Introducing Fedora CoreOS](https://fedoramagazine.org/introducing-fedora-coreos/ "Introducing Fedora CoreOS") — Fedora CoreOS is built to be the secure and reliable host for your compute clusters. It’s designed specifically for running containerized workloads without regular maintenance, automatically updating itself with the latest OS improvements, bug fixes, and security updates
  * [Fedora CoreOS - Getting Started](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/getting-started/ "Fedora CoreOS - Getting Started") — Fedora CoreOS has no install-time configuration. Every Fedora CoreOS system begins with a generic, unconfigured disk image. On first boot Ignition will read the supplied config and configure the system. Ignition configs are usually supplied via the cloud’s userdata mechanism, or, in the case of bare metal, injected at install time. This guide will show you how to launch Fedora CoreOS on AWS, QEMU, and bare metal as well as how to create Ignition configs. 
  * [Podman](https://podman.io/ "Podman") — What is Podman? Podman is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI Containers on your Linux System. Containers can either be run as root or in rootless mode. Simply put: `alias docker=podman`.
  * [Buildah, Podman, and Skopeo – the BIT that matters](http://saharsh.org/2019/01/18/buildah_podman_skopeo/ "Buildah, Podman, and Skopeo – the BIT that matters") — Still doing all your Linux container management using an insecure, bloated daemon? Well, don’t feel bad. I was too until very recently. Now I’m finding myself slowly saying goodbye to my beloved Docker daemon and saying hello to Buildah, Podman, and Skopeo. In this article, I explore the exciting new world of rootless and daemon-less Linux container tools.
  * [Replacing Docker with Podman](https://medium.com/@ganeshmani009/replacing-docker-with-podman-power-of-podman-cloudnweb-23cfb7541538 "Replacing Docker with Podman") — Yeah, you read it right… while Docker is a buzzword in the tech industry now. we will see the consequences of using it and how we can solve the problem with Podman. Replacing Docker with Podman 
  * [etcd: Distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system](https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd "etcd: Distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system") — etcd is a distributed reliable key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system
  * [Ubuntu Core](https://ubuntu.com/core#security-first "Ubuntu Core") — We redesigned the entire system from first boot to create the most secure embedded Linux for devices and connected things.
