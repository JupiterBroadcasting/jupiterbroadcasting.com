### Episode Links

  * [Marco Arment on Twitter](https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1099406116516253696 "Marco Arment on Twitter") — Add up all of the time you’ve spent learning Swift from scratch, accommodating its strictness, fighting its buggy tools, migrating your code through language changes, and re-learning APIs and conventions as they’ve changed over the last 5 years. I’ve spent zero time doing that.
  * [A Swift Takes Flight on Windows](https://forums.swift.org/t/a-swift-takes-flight/20845 "A Swift Takes Flight on Windows") — I have finally managed to get the compiler, the support libraries, the runtime, standard library, libdispatch, and now, Foundation to build and run on Windows! 
  * [Apple Plans to Close Stores in Eastern District of Texas in Fight Against Patent Trolls](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/02/22/apple-closing-stores-in-eastern-district-texas/ "Apple Plans to Close Stores in Eastern District of Texas in Fight Against Patent Trolls") — To continue to serve the region, Apple plans to open a new store at the Galleria Dallas shopping mall in Dallas, just outside the Eastern District of Texas border.
  * [Linux Academy - Full Stack Ruby on Rails Developer (Remote)](https://jobs.lever.co/linuxacademy/b1b75b6a-a54c-4854-809f-f36ed4f08f28 "Linux Academy - Full Stack Ruby on Rails Developer \(Remote\)") — Your primary focus will be development of all server-side logic, definition and maintenance of the central database, and ensuring high performance and responsiveness to requests from the front-end. 
  * [What is Serverless?](https://serverless-stack.com/chapters/what-is-serverless.html "What is Serverless?") — Serverless computing (or serverless for short), is an execution model where the cloud provider (AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud) is responsible for executing a piece of code by dynamically allocating the resources. 
  * [Serverless Architectures - Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html "Serverless Architectures - Martin Fowler") — Serverless architectures are application designs that incorporate third-party “Backend as a Service” (BaaS) services, and/or that include custom code run in managed, ephemeral containers on a “Functions as a Service” (FaaS) platform.
  * [Serverless Architectures at AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/serverless-architectures-learn-more/ "Serverless Architectures at AWS") — A serverless architecture is a way to build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure.
