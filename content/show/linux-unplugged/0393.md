  * [AmpliPi - Home Audio System — Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/micro-nova/amplipi-home-audio-system "AmpliPi - Home Audio System — Kickstarter") — One thing that sets apart the AmpliPi design is that we have made it open source, from the software, to the firmware, to the schematics. The REST API and Web App are written in Python and run on a Raspberry Pi 3+ Compute Module.
  * [The Coder](http://thecoder.shop/ "The Coder") — The Coder is made from 100% cotton terry velour for soft, cozy wear. Embroidered on the left chest with a classic white on black Coder Radio logo.
