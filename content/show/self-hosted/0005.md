### Episode Links

  * [The Perfect Media Server - 2019 Edition](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2019/07/16/perfect-media-server-2019/ "The Perfect Media Server - 2019 Edition") — Reliable means you don't lose data. And that's exactly what the MergerFS + Snapraid combo I first wrote about in 2016 has provided. A solid, boring and reliable way of storing multiple TBs of data with little fuss.
  * [Getting started with ZFS on Linux](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2019/05/14/getting-started-with-zfs-on-linux/ "Getting started with ZFS on Linux") — Here's a short article giving a ZFS 101 intro and list of commands in one place.
  * [New Hard Drive rituals](https://blog.linuxserver.io/2018/10/29/new-hard-drive-rituals/ "New Hard Drive rituals") — It is for these reasons that I now religiously do not commit any data to a drive until it has undergone at least one full cycle
  * [The 'hidden' cost of using ZFS for your home NAS](https://louwrentius.com/the-hidden-cost-of-using-zfs-for-your-home-nas.html "The 'hidden' cost of using ZFS for your home NAS") — With ZFS, you either have to buy all storage you expect to need upfront, or you will be wasting a few hard drives on redundancy you don't need.
  * [Mergerfs: a featureful union filesystem](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs "Mergerfs: a featureful union filesystem")
  * [A Chat with mergerfs Developer](https://extras.fireside.fm/28 "A Chat with mergerfs Developer") — Alex, Drew from ChooseLinux and Brent (of the Brunch fame) sit down with Antonio Musumeci, the developer of mergerfs during the JB sprint.
  * [Alex's one line mergerfs fstab entry](https://slexy.org/view/s25zKMjUuZ "Alex's one line mergerfs fstab entry")
