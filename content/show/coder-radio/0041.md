  "description": "Google shuffles the head of Android to a new role, folding Android under the Chrome division. We take live calls and speculate on the long-term possible transition from Android to ChromeOS, how it would impact developers and how the transition could be accomplished. Plus rumor has it Windows Phone 8 will lose support in July 2014, and the dark cloud of uncertainty around the struggling platform this creates. Then the hard choice when developing for desktop Linux, the Samsung problem, and much more!",
