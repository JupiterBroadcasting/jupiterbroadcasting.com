### Episode Links

  * [EndeavourOS first stable release](https://endeavouros.com/endeavouros-first-stable-release-has-arrived/ "EndeavourOS first stable release") — We’re proud to present you our very first stable release of EndeavourOS. 
  * [RetroArch coming to Steam](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/07/retroarch-the-worlds-largest-emulation-front-end-coming-to-steam-july-30/ "RetroArch coming to Steam") — But will this "completely free" release run afoul of Steam Community Guidelines?
  * [Introducing ubuntu-wsl](https://balintreczey.hu/blog/introducing-ubuntu-wsl-the-package-making-ubuntu-better-and-better-on-wsl/ "Introducing ubuntu-wsl") — “A collection of utilities for WSL” to let you create shortcuts on the Windows desktop with wslusc, start the default Windows browser with wslview, and do a few other things.
  * [WSL - Ubuntu Wiki](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WSL "WSL - Ubuntu Wiki")
  * [EvilGnome: Rare Malware Spying on Desktop Users](https://www.intezer.com/blog-evilgnome-rare-malware-spying-on-linux-desktop-users/ "EvilGnome: Rare Malware Spying on Desktop Users") — We have named the implant EvilGnome, for its disguise as a Gnome extension. The malware is currently fully undetected across all major security solutions. EvilGnome is a rare type of malware due to its appetite for Linux desktop users. 
  * [Macbook keyboard and trackpad support coming to Linux 5.3](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Linux-5.3-MacBook-Key-Trackpads "Macbook keyboard and trackpad support coming to Linux 5.3") — Linux up to now hasn't had mainline support for the keyboard and trackpad on recent years of MacBooks: from MacBook8,1 or later or MacBookPro13 and MacBookPro14 models. These IDs roughly correlate to the MacBook systems since the end of 2015. 
  * [Maintainer for gpodder.net needed](https://github.com/gpodder/mygpo/blob/master/maintainer-needed.md "Maintainer for gpodder.net needed") — Some effort is required to keep a website or web service running and up-to-date. I (the current maintainer) have enough time to keep the system up and running for now, but no time to do any improvements and other development.
