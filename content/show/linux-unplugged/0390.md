  * [Security Disclosure 2: vulnerabilities in custom integrations HACS, Font Awesome and others - Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2021/01/23/security-disclosure2/ "Security Disclosure 2: vulnerabilities in custom integrations HACS, Font Awesome and others - Home Assistant") — Multiple custom integrations were found that allowed an attacker to steal any file without logging in.

  * [FEDORA-2021-48866282e5 — security update for chromium — Fedora Updates System](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2021-48866282e5 "FEDORA-2021-48866282e5 — security update for chromium — Fedora Updates System") — I gave a lot of thought to whether I wanted to continue to maintain the Chromium package in Fedora, given that many (most?) users will be confused/annoyed when API functionality like sync and geolocation stops working for no good reason. Ultimately, I decided to continue for now, because there were at least some users who didn't mind, and if I stopped, someone else would start over and run blindly into this problem.
