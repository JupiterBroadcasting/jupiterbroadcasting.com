You say that you don’t want to pay all those RHEL developers? Here’s how you can save money: just pull from us. Become a downstream distributor of Oracle Linux. We will happily take on the burden.

SUSE plans to contribute this project to an open source foundation, which will provide ongoing free access to alternative source code.
  * [Why SUSE is forking Red Hat Enterprise Linux](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/11/why-suse-is-forking-red-hat-enterprise-linux/ "Why SUSE is forking Red Hat Enterprise Linux") — SUSE CEO Dirk-Peter van Leeuwen today argues that SUSE is wading into this because of its belief that “becoming more proprietary should not be the basis for competition between open source companies."

  * [Endless OS’s privacy-preserving metrics system](https://blogs.gnome.org/wjjt/2023/07/05/endless-oss-privacy-preserving-metrics-system/ "Endless OS’s privacy-preserving metrics system") — Let’s stare directly at the elephant in the room: usage metrics – telemetry, analytics, or whatever other terms one might like to use – is something that free software community members are often opposed to, with some good justification.
