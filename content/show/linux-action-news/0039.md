  * [GNOME and KDE in PureOS: diversity across devices](https://puri.sm/posts/gnome-and-kde-in-pureos-diversity-across-devices/ "GNOME and KDE in PureOS: diversity across devices") — If we were doing short-term planning it would be easy to “just use Plasma” for the Librem 5, but that would undermine our long-term vision of having a consistent look/feel across all our devices, where GNOME/GTK+ is already the default and what we’ve invested in.

We aim to use only Wayland, trying to get rid of as much X11 legacy as we possibly can, for performance issues and for better security. From our discussions with GNOME maintainers of existing compositors and shells, we may be better off igniting a new compositor (upstreamed and backed by GNOME) in order to avoid the X11 baggage.
