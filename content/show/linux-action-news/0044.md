  * [OpenWatch](https://www.xda-developers.com/blocks-project-openwatch-android/ "OpenWatch") — Modular smartphone and smartwatch devices may be a niche idea, but it’s one that has a lot of passionate people behind it. The process of having to buy a brand new device just to upgrade or replace a single component feels very archaic. Unless you’re willing to pry apart a device yourself (or pay someone to do it), you’re forced to purchase a brand new device when something inside of it breaks.
  * [Fedora IoT Edition](https://nullr0ute.com/2018/03/fedora-iot-edition-is-go/ "Fedora IoT Edition") — So what will be happening over the coming weeks (and months)? We’ll be getting the working group in place, getting an initial monthly release process in place so that people can start to have something to kick the tires with and provide feedback and drive discussion. 
  * [More AMP tyranny from Google](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/8/17095078/google-amp-accelerated-mobile-page-announcement-standard-web-packaging-urls "More AMP tyranny from Google") — Google’s goal is to extend support in features like the Top Stories carousel to AMP-like content that (1) meets a set of performance and user experience criteria and (2) implements a set of new web standards. Some of the proposed standards in the critical path are Feature Policy, Web Packaging, iframe promotion, Performance Timeline, and Paint Timing.
  * [​GitHub makes open-source project licensing easier with an open-source program | ZDNet](http://www.zdnet.com/article/github-makes-open-source-project-licensing-easier-with-an-open-source-program/ "​GitHub makes open-source project licensing easier with an open-source program | ZDNet") — GitHub has open sourced Licensed, an internal tool they've used to automate some of GitHub's open-source projects licensing process.
  * [Debian & Kali Linux Are Now On Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Debian-Kali-On-Windows-WSL "Debian & Kali Linux Are Now On Windows Subsystem for Linux") — Joining Kali, Ubuntu, SUSE, and openSUSE on Windows WSL now is also Debian Linux. 
  * [SCALE 16x Report](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/16x "SCALE 16x Report") — SCaLE 16X – the 16th annual Southern California Linux Expo. Pasadena Convention Center.
