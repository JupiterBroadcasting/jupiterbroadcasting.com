Yang mentioned how "in production terms it'll ramp very quickly, in the first month very quickly we'll be in the tens of thousands, by the second month we'll be in the hundreds of thousands and beyond that it'll grow even quicker".

When upgrading, a new operating system image is written to whichever partition is not currently in use, before rebooting the system. A specialized bootloader module then automatically selects the newer operating system and boots into it. 
  * [Portable Linux gaming with the Steam Deck](https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/news-and-events/portable-linux-gaming-with-the-steam-deck.html "Portable Linux gaming with the Steam Deck")
  * [Linux kernel edges closer to dropping ReiserFS](https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/24/linux_kernel_takes_a_step/ "Linux kernel edges closer to dropping ReiserFS") — The problem was that ReiserFS code in the kernel used some API calls that nothing else did, preventing them from being changed or enhanced. For now, one of the other ReiserFS developers has contributed a patch that removes the issue.
  * [CentOS New “AutoSD” Distribution Announced For In-Vehicle Linux Distro](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=CentOS-AutoSD-Announced "CentOS New “AutoSD” Distribution Announced For In-Vehicle Linux Distro") — CentOS Automotive Stream Distribution is their binary distribution that will serve as a public, in-development preview of Red Hat's upcoming in-vehicle operating system. CentOS formed their Automotive SIG last year with Red Hat working on a RHEL-based in-vehicle Linux platform that is yet to be publicly released.

  * [Zaolin on Twitter](https://twitter.com/_zaolin_/status/1497237365135491072 "Zaolin on Twitter") — For everyone wondering what’s @IntelSoftware planning for the Firmware Support Package 3.0 #fsp and USF is basically going fully closed-source on the firmware side. This means Intel’s #fsp decides to drop #OSF open-source firmware. It’s really a shame…

  * [Intel’s software-defined silicon set to debut in Linux 5.18](https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/14/intel_sdsi_linux_5_18/ "Intel’s software-defined silicon set to debut in Linux 5.18") — The existence of software-defined silicon (SDSI) emerged in October 2021 when Intel staffers posted to the Linux Kernel mailing list with hints about new functionality that would allow users to purchase licenses that turned on capabilities physically present in processors, but which are not available to use out of the box.
