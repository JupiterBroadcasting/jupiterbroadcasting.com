### Episode Links

  * [Jupiter Broadcasting Joins Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com/blog/linuxacademy-com/jupiter-broadcasting-joins-linux-academy/ "Jupiter Broadcasting Joins Linux Academy") — Jupiter Broadcasting has been creating the world’s favorite podcasts on Linux, open source, and free software since before they were even called podcasts. By teaming up, we’re bringing together two industry-leading companies that develop and deliver the content that our community really wants.
  * [Nextcloud 14 now available](https://nextcloud.com/blog/nextcloud-14-now-available-with-video-verification-signaltelegram-2fa-support-improved-collaboration-and-gdpr-compliance/ "Nextcloud 14 now available")
  * [Supercharging Solus Infrastructure](https://getsol.us/2018/09/08/supercharging-solus-infrastructure/ "Supercharging Solus Infrastructure") — Because of the timing of these upgrades and our lack of access to the solus-project.com domain, Bryan and I are going to be shifting Solus services over to the getsol.us domain.
