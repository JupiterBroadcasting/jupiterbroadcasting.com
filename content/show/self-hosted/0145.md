The reality is that we need more resources to continue putting forth the best personal media experience, and as a result, we will no longer offer remote playback as a free feature. Thisâ€”alongside the new Plex Pass pricingâ€”will help provide those resources. This change will apply to the future release of our new Plex experience for mobile and other platforms.
