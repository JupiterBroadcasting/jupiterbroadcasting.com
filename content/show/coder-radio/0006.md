  * Why should I care?
  * Where would I find low level languages in use today.

#### UNLIMITED POWER!!!!!(Sorta)

  * Generally, the lower you go the more efficient your code.
  * C will have a much faster startup time than higher level languages
  * More portable than you might think….
  * Higher level languages Java in particular have been inching closer and closer to C / C++ running speed

  * GCC / LLVM — make sure you never go it alone
  * Proprietary extensions…. Bad for the web — bad for native code
