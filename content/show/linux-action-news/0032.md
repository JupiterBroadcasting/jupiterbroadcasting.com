### Episode Links

  * [Introducing Amazon Linux 2](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2017/12/introducing-amazon-linux-2/ "Introducing Amazon Linux 2") — Amazon Linux 2 provides a modern execution environment with LTS Kernel (4.9) tuned for optimal performance on Amazon Web Services (AWS), systemd support, and newer tooling (gcc 7.2.1, glibc 2.25, binutils 2.27). 
  * [Amazon Linux 2 Benchmarks](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=amazon-linux-2 "Amazon Linux 2 Benchmarks") — With Amazon AWS this week having released Amazon Linux 2 LTS I was excited to put this updated cloud-focused operating system through some performance tests to see how it stacks up with the more well known Linux distributions.
  * [OpenSSH coming to Windows 10](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16775764/microsoft-windows-10-openssh-client-support "OpenSSH coming to Windows 10") — The software giant is now adding a native OpenSSH client to Windows 10. It’s available immediately as a beta option in the Fall Creators Update for Windows 10, and it’s easy to enable.
  * [Not just the client](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15904265 "Not just the client") — we also shipped OpenSSH's sshd server, but it's a little tricky to configure right now. Expect a blog post this week. * This is not production-ready in the current version of Windows 10 (hence the "(Beta)" in the label), but we hope to be soon.
  * [Mozilla faces blowback after slipping Mr Robot plugin into Firefox](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/16/16784628/mozilla-mr-robot-arg-plugin-firefox-looking-glass "Mozilla faces blowback after slipping Mr Robot plugin into Firefox") — Firefox users noticed a strange new plug-in popping up in their browsers. A new plug-in called Looking Glass found its way into each instance of the new Firefox Quantum browser. It was disabled by default, but users were still alarmed to see a plugin they hadn’t installed.
  * [Steve Klabnik on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/steveklabnik/status/941709048529014784 "Steve Klabnik on Twitter") — I am pretty upset with my employer, @mozilla, today 
  * [Carol Nichols, Rus Dev on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Carols10cents/status/942177621772849152 "Carol Nichols, Rus Dev on Twitter") — "Mozilla wasn't paid for the Mr. Robot tie-in" 
  * [Intel to slap hardware lock on Management Engine code to thwart downgrade attacks](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/12/13/intel_management_engine_gets_hardwarebased_lock/ "Intel to slap hardware lock on Management Engine code to thwart downgrade attacks") — From version 12 onward, ME-equipped chips will defend against patch rollbacks.
  * [Conservancy update on fight with Law Center](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2017/dec/11/ttab-summary-judgment-motion/ "Conservancy update on fight with Law Center") — Today, Conservancy filed for summary judgment in SFLC's trademark cancellation action. As I understand from our lawyers, summary judgment is a mechanism to ask a Court to expediently handle a matter where the facts are straightforward and, as a matter of law, there is no plausible way that the party filing for summary judgment won't prevail. 
  * [TechSNAP reboot](http://techsnap.systems/ "TechSNAP reboot") — Systems, Network, and Administration Podcast. Every week TechSNAP covers the stories that impact those of us in the tech industry, and all of us that follow it. Every episode we dedicate a portion of the show to answer audience questions, discuss best practices, and solving your problems.
