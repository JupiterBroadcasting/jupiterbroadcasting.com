  * [Public Money? Public Code! - FSFE](https://fsfe.org/activities/publiccode/publiccode.en.html "Public Money?

  * [Fountain on Twitter](https://twitter.com/fountain_app/status/1657139753555222528 "Fountain on Twitter") — BALLER BOOSTS ARE BACK We have partnered with @bitrefill to give away a $50 Bitrefill Balance Card to two super-fans on Fountain every week. All you have to do is BOOST
