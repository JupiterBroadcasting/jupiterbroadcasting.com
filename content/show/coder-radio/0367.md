  * [Feedback on Coder Radio 366](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoderRadio/comments/ce1ef7/functional_first_coder_radio_366/eu1qtll/ "Feedback on Coder Radio 366") — As a C++ developer working on a large, primarily OO codebase, I’ve been writing ever more C++ as “just a pipeline of data transformations.” As you guys mentioned, you can get a lot of benefit even in an OO situation from wrapping a functional “core” up in an object “package.”
  * [Functional Core, Imperative Shell](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell "Functional Core, Imperative Shell") — In this screencast we look at one method for crossing this divide. We review a Twitter client whose core is functional: managing tweets, syncing timelines to incoming Twitter API data, remembering cursor positions within the tweet list, and rendering tweets to text for display. This functional core is surrounded by a shell of imperative code: it manipulates stdin, stdout, the database, and the network, all based on values produced by the functional core. 
  * [Postmodern immutable data structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_m0ce1rzRI "Postmodern immutable data structures") — We are presenting Immer, a C++ library implementing modern and efficient data immutable data structures. 
  * [Mike on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dominucco/status/1151166107232940034 "Mike on Twitter") — So when I just was getting started I was an #emacs user but had that beaten out of me. I’m thinking of looking back at it on #macOS and #Linux under GNOME any recommendations?
  * [Spacemacs: Emacs advanced Kit focused on Evil](http://spacemacs.org/ "Spacemacs: Emacs advanced Kit focused on Evil") — Spacemacs is a new way to experience Emacs -- a sophisticated and polished set-up focused on ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency.
  * [Tinder Bypasses Google Play, Revolt Against App Store Fee](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-19/tinder-bypasses-google-play-joining-revolt-against-app-store-fee "Tinder Bypasses Google Play, Revolt Against App Store Fee") — Tinder joined a growing backlash against app store taxes by bypassing Google Play in a move that could shake up the billion-dollar industry dominated by Google and Apple Inc. 
  * [EmacsWiki: Evil](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil "EmacsWiki: Evil") — Evil is an extensible vi layer for Emacs. It provides Vim features like Visual selection and text objects.
  * [A personal story about 10× development](http://nibblestew.blogspot.com/2019/07/a-personal-story-about-10-development.html "A personal story about 10× development") — The "×ness" of any developer does not exist in a vacuum but depends on many organizational things. The most obvious one is tooling.
  * [Shekhar Kirani on Twitter](https://twitter.com/skirani/status/1149302828420067328 "Shekhar Kirani on Twitter") — 10x engineers. Founders if you ever come across this rare breed of engineers, grab them. If you have a 10x engineer as part of your first few engineers, you increase the odds of your startup success significantly.
  * [The mythical 10x programmer - <antirez>](http://antirez.com/news/112 "The mythical 10x programmer - <antirez>") — The following is a list of qualities that I believe make the most difference in programmers productivity. 
  * [rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop "rubocop") — RuboCop is a Ruby static code analyzer and code formatter. Out of the box it will enforce many of the guidelines outlined in the community Ruby Style Guide.
