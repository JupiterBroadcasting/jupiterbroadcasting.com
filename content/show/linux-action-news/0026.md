  * [SCO vs. IBM Lives on](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/11/02/ibm_vs_sco_revives/ "SCO vs. IBM Lives on") — As Groklaw records, this case kicked off in 2003. The dispute centres on “Project Monterey” a joint effort by SCO and IBM to build a unified UNIX capable of running on several different microprocessor architectures. SCO – at that time known as the Santa Cruz Operation – sold versions of UNIX and tossed some of its source code into the Project Monterey mix, as did IBM. The parties signed a “joint development agreement” (JDA) to formalise the deal.
  * [SFLC files a suit against Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2017/nov/03/sflc-legal-action/ "SFLC files a suit against Conservancy") — This trademark action is in its early stages.
