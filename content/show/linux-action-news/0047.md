  * [The final nail in the Firefox OS coffin](https://liliputing.com/2018/03/the-app-store-for-firefox-os-shuts-down-on-march-30th.html "The final nail in the Firefox OS coffin") — the Firefox Marketplace is shutting down on March 30th, 2018, which means the handful of folks who actually have devices running Firefox OS won’t be able to download apps from the official app store after that.
  * [Google removes Kodi from autocomplete](https://torrentfreak.com/google-adds-kodi-to-autocomplete-piracy-filter-180328/ "Google removes Kodi from autocomplete") — C: 30NEWS Google has banned the term "Kodi" from the autocomplete feature of its search engine. This means that the popular software and related suggestions won't appear unless users type out the full term. Google has previously taken similar measures against "pirate" related terms and confirms that Kodi is targeted because it's "closely associated with copyright infringement."
  * [Facebook Container for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/ "Facebook Container for Firefox") — Prevent Facebook from tracking you around the web. The Facebook Container extension for Firefox helps you take control and isolate your web activity from Facebook.

  * [Oracle vs Google case not dead](https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/27/17169064/federal-circuit-oracle-v-google-third-trial-java-android "Oracle vs Google case not dead") — The Federal Circuit has ruled for a second time in Oracle v. Google, the software copyright lawsuit over Google’s Android platform. The new decision reverses the district court yet again and sends the case back for a third trial to determine damages for Oracle. In the last trial, Oracle sought almost $9 billion in damages.
  * [Microsoft facilitating yet more distros on WSL](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2018/03/26/wsl-distro-launcher/ "Microsoft facilitating yet more distros on WSL") — This sample allows distro maintainers to build WSL distro packages for the Microsoft Store and developers to create custom Linux distro packages for sideloading. You can find the distro launcher repo on GitHub.
