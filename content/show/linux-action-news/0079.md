### Episode Links

  * [Booting Linux on new Macs](https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=Apple-T2-Blocks-Linux-UEFI "Booting Linux on new Macs") — Apple's T2 security chip being embedded into their newest products provides a secure enclave, APFS storage encryption, UEFI Secure Boot validation, Touch ID handling, a hardware microphone disconnect on lid close, and other security tasks. The T2 restricts the boot process quite a bit and verifies each step of the process using crypto keys signed by Apple. 
  * [WSL gets new features](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2018/11/microsoft-adds-more-features-to-windows-subsystem-for-linux "WSL gets new features") — A slate of improvements to the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) feature in the Windows 10 October 2018 Update. 
  * [Samsung announce Linux on DeX](https://blog.ubuntu.com/2018/11/08/samsung-announce-linux-dex-ubuntu-developers "Samsung announce Linux on DeX") — Samsung is announcing the beta launch of Linux on DeX which extends the value of Samsung DeX to Linux developers. Linux on DeX empowers developers to build apps within a Linux development environment by connecting their Galaxy device to a larger screen for a PC-like experience.
  * [Linux on Dex](https://www.linuxondex.com/ "Linux on Dex")
  * [KDE Connect Updated](https://nicolasfella.wordpress.com/2018/11/04/kde-connect-new-stuff-0x3/ "KDE Connect Updated") — Android Oreo introduced some restrictions in regard to apps running in the background. In the future in order to be able to run in the background KDE Connect needs to show a persistent notification. The good news is that you can hide the notification. The (slightly) bad news is that we cannot do it by default. To hide the notification you need to long-press it and switch it off. Other notifications from KDE Connect are unaffected by this.
  * [GSConnect updated](https://github.com/andyholmes/gnome-shell-extension-gsconnect/releases/tag/v15 "GSConnect updated") — The GNOME Shell UI has been rewritten to better conform to design guidelines. Appearance is important to everyone and work will continue to improve usability for touchscreens, HiDPI and users requiring accessibility features. 
  * [Librem 5 slips again](https://puri.sm/posts/librem5-2018-11-hardware-report/ "Librem 5 slips again") — I am reluctant to give a new timeline for shipping the dev kits… What we know is that our new PCB fabrication here in the USA will be 11 business days. We will make over 300 of these boards, which are pretty complex—we have over 160 different parts and more than 500 components in total per board. This takes some time, even with the amazing SMT machines placing tiny parts.
  * [Nexus devices finally dead](https://www.xda-developers.com/nexus-5x-nexus-6p-end-of-life/ "Nexus devices finally dead") — An over-the-air (OTA) update, which is based on Android 8.1 Oreo, is now rolling out to both the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P (as well as to the Pixel/Pixel XL, the Pixel 2/Pixel 2 XL, and Pixel 3/Pixel 3 XL), bumping up both phones to the latest November security patches. But if Google’s update policies are to be followed here, then this will be the last update to be released to both Nexus phones, meaning that the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P have now officially reached end-of-life (EOL) status. Furthermore, online and phone support for both devices is also being discontinued.
