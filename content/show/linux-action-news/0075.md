  * [Ubuntu Touch OTA 5 released](https://ubports.com/blog/ubports-blog-1/post/ubuntu-touch-ota-5-174 "Ubuntu Touch OTA 5 released") — While many have already joined the community on 16.04 with OTA-4, in addition to the long-term support of upstream Ubuntu development, OTA-5 will include a more stable experience, new tweaks, and new features to show off this next stage of Ubuntu Touch development.
  * [Plasma 5.14 released](https://www.kde.org/announcements/plasma-5.14.0.php "Plasma 5.14 released") — A lot of work has gone into improving Discover, Plasma's software manager, and, among other things, we have added a Firmware Update feature and many subtle user interface improvements to give it a smoother feel. We have also rewritten many effects in our window manager KWin and improved it for slicker animations in your work day. Other improvements we have made include a new Display Configuration widget which is useful when giving presentations.
  * [User Error Episode 50: Understand The Hype](https://error.show/50 "User Error Episode 50: Understand The Hype") — It seems to be all about Plasma these days so we want to know if the hype is justified. 
  * [Website criticises Flatpaks](https://flatkill.org/ "Website criticises Flatpaks") — To make matters worse, the users are misled to believe the apps run sandboxed. For all these apps flatpak shows a reassuring "sandbox" icon when installing the app
  * [Redis modules forked](https://www.zdnet.com/article/redis-labs-and-common-clause-attacked-where-it-hurts-with-open-source-code/ "Redis modules forked") — Redis put some of the program's code under the anti-open-source Common Clause license. Now, developers are counterattacking by forking the code.
  * [Microsoft joins OIN](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-joins-open-invention-network-to-help-protect-linux-and-open-source/ "Microsoft joins OIN") — Joining OIN reflects Microsoft’s patent practice evolving in lock-step with the company’s views on Linux and open source more generally.
  * [ChromeOS tablet launched](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/9/17940770/google-pixel-slate-tablet-announcement-price-release-date-specs "ChromeOS tablet launched") — The Pixel Slate is a Chrome OS tablet with a detachable keyboard cover that turns it into something very closely resembling a laptop.
  * [Restyling apps at scale](https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2018/10/15/restyling-apps-at-scale/ "Restyling apps at scale")
