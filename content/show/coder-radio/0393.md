  * [Jeremy Soller on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeremy_soller/status/1340659344153608193?s=21 "Jeremy Soller on Twitter") — "I can no longer let things like this go. While System76 has been a part of the process, this should not be interpreted as consent to the new GNOME Shell design. We will do whatever possible to improve Pop!_OS UX even if it breaks significantly from GNOME's defaults."
