  "description": "Yahoo disappoints Mike and Chris with their high-profile announcement that all remote workers must return to their cubes.

Plus the awkward gadget habit our jobs can force us to have, the possibilities Sony\u2019s PS4 could present indie game devs, an honest look at the Chrome Pixel, and much more!",
