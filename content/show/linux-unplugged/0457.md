### Episode Links

  * [New NASA Black Hole Sonifications with a Remix](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/news/new-nasa-black-hole-sonifications-with-a-remix.html "New NASA Black Hole Sonifications with a Remix") â€” In some ways, this sonification is unlike any other done before because it revisits the actual sound waves discovered in data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. The popular misconception that there is no sound in space originates with the fact that most of space is essentially a vacuum, providing no medium for sound waves to propagate through. A galaxy cluster, on the other hand, has copious amounts of gas that envelop the hundreds or even thousands of galaxies within it, providing a medium for the sound waves to travel.
  * [LXD vs Docker](https://ubuntu.com/blog/lxd-vs-docker "LXD vs Docker") â€” System containers (as run by LXD) are similar to virtual or physical machines. They run a full operating system inside them, you can run any type of workload, and you manage them exactly as you would a virtual or a physical machine.

While everyone is isolated at home, this series brought people together to learn a valuable new skill.
