  * [Some 5.12 development statistics](https://lwn.net/Articles/853039/ "Some 5.12 development statistics") — By the time the 5.12 kernel was finally released, some 13,015 non-merge changesets had been pulled into the mainline repository for this development cycle. That makes 5.12 the slowest development cycle since 5.6, which was released at the end of March 2020. Still, there was plenty of work done for 5.12.
  * [Linux 5.12 Release Announcement](https://lwn.net/Articles/854420/ "Linux 5.12 Release Announcement")

Judging by Linux-next, 5.13 will be making up for it."

  * [steam-runtime-tools: pressure-vessel](https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/steam-runtime-tools/-/blob/master/pressure-vessel/README.md "steam-runtime-tools: pressure-vessel") — pressure-vessel is a bit like a simplified version of Flatpak for Steam games.

  * [Looking forward to Fedora 34](https://lwn.net/Articles/852541/ "Looking forward to Fedora 34") — In 2021, complaints about PulseAudio are scarce indeed; the quirks have long since been ironed out and, for most people, sound just works. Obviously, it must be time to rip out the audio infrastructure and start over. That is what Fedora has done in the 34 release; PulseAudio is gone, replaced by PipeWire.

A term like that may sound scary at first, but less technical users need not be wary. This change is simple to grasp, and will help many Workstation users in several key areas.
