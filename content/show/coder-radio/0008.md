### Episode Links

#### Feedback

  * Emmet rights in again, sharing a solution to his issue.
  * Charles schools me a bit on the nitty gritty differences between LLVM and GCC. He also points out that C was at one point called “Portable Assembler”, so HAH!
  * Nicholas sends me a message in C!
  * James asks if I am using the Intel River Trail API at all and asks if we have a CR subreddit.
  * [Atcl shares a great resource and some thoughts on the value of knowing assembler](http://www.ohloh.net/languages/compare2201.html?measure=commits&percent=true&l0=assembler&l1=c&l2=cpp&l3=java&l4=csharp&l6=-1&commit=Update\\%22)
  * Brandon would like some information on services like oDesk, eLance, and vWorker as a source for work.
  * Thomas and a number of others have joined me in trying Pomodoro coding and overall they seem to like it.

#### Technical Dependencies

  * What’s a dependency?
  * Dependencies you must take.
  * The risk of taking too many dependencies
  * [Avoiding Dependencies](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/01/dependency-avoidance.html/index.html)
  * [This sounds an awful lot like “Not Invented Here Syndrome”](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000007.html/index.html)

#### Distribution Dependencies: What Is a Store When It Wants to Be More?

  * [GOLD RUSH!](http://daveaddey.com/index914f.html?p=893\\%22)
  * [Do App Stores show preference to “certain” developers?](http://www.pcworld.com/article/189973/apple_app_stores_dirty_little_secret.html/index.html)
  * Distribution limited API’s?
  * Those rankings are legit… right?
  * Those reviews are real… right?
  * App Stores put small and large developers on a level playing field… maybe… no?
  * These problems are coming to an OS near you.

#### Human Dependencies or the Rockstar Syndrome

  * About that bus….
  * Fire any and all “Rockstars”
